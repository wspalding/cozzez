I paid attention when I carried my gun around.', 'text': \"\\n 2019 NBC NEWS.COM\\nWalmart announced last week that they no longer welcome customers who engage in open carry  carrying a gun, in public, for everyone to see. Kroger joined them within hours, and CVS, Walgreens and Wegmans followed suit before the end of the week. This week, Meijer, Aldi and Publix joined in as well.\\nTheir decisions are not terribly novel: the retailers have simply made the same business decision that other corporate titans, including Target, Costco and Starbucks, made before. Theyve simply decided that eliminating open carry in their store, referred to by gun advocates as constitutional carry, is the right thing to do, particularly for the customers who dont openly carry guns. (For the record, this decision simply eliminated open carry by private citizens and most gun and ammunition sales at Walmart; law enforcement officers will still be welcome to bring their weapons into the store, as will private citizens with concealed carry permits.)\\nThis was all big news, but Walmart felt like a particularly betrayal to gun lovers, as the worlds largest brick and mortar retailer, by far the largest retailer in rural America and a major supplier of guns and ammunition  though its also stepping back from selling certain kinds of ammunition and even certain guns at some locations.\\nWalmarts decision, though, makes sense. On August 3, a mass shooting in Walmarts El Paso store killed 22 and wounded 24 more, and that came just days after a disgruntled employee murdered two co-workers and attempted to murder a police officer in a Mississippi store. Since those events and the national outcry that followed  but before the bans  at least one open-carry enthusiast in Missouri did what he called a social experiment testing Walmarts dedication to the right to keep and bear arms, causing a panic; other people made threats leading to panicked evacuations that alarmed their staff and their customers, who feared they might be the next Americans to die in a mass shooting.\\nAfter the bans, one gun rights group naturally responded to the request by Walmart for customers to refrain from displaying weapons in their stores by encouraging its members to open carry.\\nWalmarts decision has been hailed by investors and praised by many of their customers, and theyve seen their stock price rise to an all-time high. Walmart has real fears of losing more valuable market share to competitors whose stores are gun-free, especially in the more liberal urban and suburban areas where Walmart would like to grow, and despite what Wayne LaPierre and the NRA say this seems to be the right thing for their business.\\nBut there are millions of Americans who think its a terrible thing. They see this as one of their fundamental rights being curtailed and an open invitation for criminals to attack them and their neighbors.\\nFor much of our history, some Americans have believed that the right to keep and bear arms is what ensures their freedom. As the old maxim goes, God made Man, but Sam Colt made him equal; private firearms ownership is said to have democratized (to some people) law enforcement in early America and supposedly allowed those who could obtain and effectively use guns to live without fear of being victimized by others who could obtain and effectively use guns. Many of the people who engage in open carry today do so because they believe theyre protecting themselves and everyone else by being armed; their ability to open carry, they believe, provides both protection to others and deterrence to a few  a tradition that they believe goes back to colonial times and a public service for which all of the rest of us should be thankful.\\nThere are real problems with this view, starting with the fact that the old maxim about Sam Colt started as an ad to sell Colt revolvers, to the truth of who was allowed to own guns and when they were allowed to actually carry them, to the historical context about firearms, technology, property rights and the development of urban society.\\nFundamentally, though, todays America is entirely different from the world Sam Colt lived in, let alone the world of the 1780s and its call for a well-regulated militia. The guns are cheaper, deadlier and easier to use than ever before, and the actual dangers tend to be different from what we commonly believe. And every concept of property rights, freedom and society are far different today from what they once were, let alone what so many people erroneously believe they were.\\nAt some point, our relationship with guns today has to change, too. Walmarts decision is just a reflection of how a strong majority of Americans agree that change is needed.\\nI dont say this as some sort of anti-gun absolutist. There was a time in my life, about 15 years ago, when I regularly carried a firearm for protection. My friend and client, Brenda Paz, had been murdered for helping law enforcement prosecute MS-13, and apparently I was next on their list. When the judge overseeing the case ordered that the U.S. Attorney, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service do everything appropriate to ensure my safety, the first thing I did (on their advice) was get myself a gun.\\nWithin a few hours, I had a concealed handgun permit and my first handgun  a Sig Sauer P230 compact .380ACP in stainless steel, a weapon specifically designed for concealed carry. One of the agents tasked with investigating Brendas murder and protecting me helped me pick it out, counseling me to choose something I could really live with. Ill never forget what he told me about carrying a gun, because I think hes right: If you really do need it, you need it all the time. If you dont need it all the time, you have to ask yourself whether you really need it at all.\\nCarrying that gun was a tremendous blessing for me, because it allowed me to go about my life (almost) just like I had before, with the confidence that I had deadly force at hand if I needed it. And much like at least some of the open (and concealed) carry enthusiasts complaining about Walmart this week, I did my best to be a careful, responsible, well-prepared gun owner, ready to protect others as well as myself.\\nBut over time, I learned something that I wish more gun owners knew: Carrying a gun isnt all its cracked up to be. I learned that most people I encountered actually didnt feel better knowing that I had a gun. And, though I tried to keep it concealed in a hip holster under a shirt or jacket, the people who inevitably did glimpse it frequently wondered why I had it and whether my gun or my presence put them in danger  like the staff and customers who panicked at that Walmart in Missouri. Even the people who knew and trusted me  knowing that I was a responsible gun owner who had been threatened  wondered if being near me in public exposed them to the same danger in which Id found myself.\\nI also learned that carrying a gun  even with a license, training and a real need for it  doesnt make me as worthy of that responsibility as real cops and soldiers are, and it didnt make me an action movie hero. Yes, I had a real, articulable need to carry a firearm and I carried one of the best made and engineered handguns available on my hip  which would have been super cool to 16-year-old me, but I didnt have the training or responsibility of a real cop and I wasn't any Jason Bourne.\\nAnd besides all of that, Im also a criminal defense attorney whos seen way too many news stories, public health reports and crime statistics to ignore the limitations and dangers of having armed citizens everywhere.\\nI needed my gun for a little more than a year, and I carried it everywhere, everyday. But then I stopped. Once the last of the trials connected to my clients murder was over, I kept finding more and more times when I couldnt justify having the gun on me, let alone force everyone else around me to have to think about it. And, like the agent said, once I didnt need it all the time, I knew I probably didnt need it at all. I havent carried it since.\\nI still have the gun, and I still have the permit. And theres certainly a part of me that appreciates knowing that I could slide that holster under my belt and carry my gun if I really felt the need to do so. But I just dont, so my gun stays locked away in a safe in my closet. Im comfortable with that. I wish more of my fellow Americans would come to the same conclusion.\\nGreg Hunter is a criminal defense lawyer in Arlington, Virginia.\\n2019 NBC UNIVERSAL\", 'author': 'Greg Hunter', 'media': None}, 'https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/trump-defends-kavanaugh-as-2020-democrats-call-for-his-removal-69004357983': {'date': datetime.date(2019, 9, 16), 'source': 'MSNBC', 'source_url': 'https://www.msnbc.com/', 'status_code': 200, 'title': 'Trump defends Kavanaugh as 2020 Democrats call for his removal', 'text': '\\nA book out Tuesday examines past accusations against Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh and presents another claim of misconduct that the FBI was told about a year ago, but did not investigate.

And as the climate debate rages on in Washington, those are the kind of impacts that seem likely to catch the attention of politicians.\\nStart by looking at the topic on everyones minds this time of year, hurricanes and tropical storms.\\nSince the 1980s, the number of tropical depressions getting big enough to acquire a name has been growing pretty steadily - systems receive names when they become strong enough to be tropical storms.\\nThere were 93 named storms in the Atlantic in the 1980s. There were 110 named storms in the Atlantic in the 1990s and a whopping 151 in the first decade of this century. The tally sits at 150 for the current decade and we are still at the peak of the 2019 season.\\nThe number of major hurricanes, above category 3, is also up since 1980, though down a bit from the last decade (so far).\\nBut the growth of extreme weather extends beyond hurricanes. An analysis of weather disasters that did more than $1 billion in damage from the National Centers for Environmental Information finds that such high-cost events are up markedly since the 1980s. (The dollar figures for the events were adjusted for inflation.)\\nThere have been 250 such events since 1980 and almost half them, 111, have occurred in the current decade. And the 2019 figure does not include any events after May, so Dorian is not on the list yet. There were only 28 billion-dollar weather events in the 1980s.\\nThere is a wide range of events in that extreme weather calculation. Besides hurricanes, it includes floods, droughts, freezes, severe storms, wildfires and winter storms. And there are some trends in the data.\\nFor instance, there were seven freeze/winter storm events on the list in the 1980s, but only six (so far) in the current decade. But there were only seven severe storms on the 1980s list and 64 in the current decade.\\nBut the most consequential trend in the eyes of Washington, might be the costs associated with these events.\\nThe 28 high-impact weather events in the 1980s cost a total of about $172 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars. But the current set of 111 storms this decade has cost a total of more than $761 billion dollars. Again, that does not include the costs of Dorian and of two other events on the list  the March floods in the Midwest and May floods of the Southern Plains.\\nWhen you tally it all up, the costs are likely to end up at three-quarters of a trillion dollars or more. And thats just for this decade. At this pace, the number seems all but certain to climb over the trillion-dollar mark in the 2020s.\\nAnd then there are the human costs. The number of fatalities from these extreme weather events has largely been climbing - from 2,800 in the 1980s to almost 5,200 this decade (again before Dorians damage is added in).\\nThere could be forces at play under those data: more expensive homes and buildings being hit leading to higher costs in some places, poor construction leading to more deaths in others. Maybe communities are building too much in places that are too prone to dangerous weather events.\\nBut the reasons are largely moot.\\nThe numbers show much more in the way of financial damage and lives lost this decade than in the past. Those are the kind of numbers that upset constituents and those concerns tend to make their way up to lawmakers and ultimately spur action.\\nYou may not want to talk about global environmental changes, but if you represent Florida or Texas or North Carolina voters are going to want to talk to you about increasing hurricane risk and damage. If you represent Iowa or Nebraska or Kansas, you can bet your constituents are going to have floods and droughts on their minds. If serve the good people of California or Montana or Colorado, chances are you are going to hear about wildfire risks.\\nClimate change is the kind of large-scale topic Washington likes to talk to death, but growing real-world dollars-and-cents impact of severe weather events is harder to ignore. And the evidence for it is mounting.\\nDante Chinni is a contributor to NBC News specializing in data analysis around campaigns, politics and culture.

The last time the union declared a strike at GM was in 2007. The two-day work stoppage was estimated to have cost the Detroit automaker more than $300 million a day.\\nUAW Vice President Terry Dittes, who oversees the unions GM unit, made the strike announcment during a press conference Sunday morning in Detroit. The strike will take effect at 11:59 p.m.\\nThe union, according to Dittes, did not make this decision lightly. He called the strike the unions last resort. He did not take questions after the remarks.\\nBrian Rothenberg, a spokesman for the union, said the union does not believe a deal will be reached to avoid a strike . He said upward of 200 or so local union leaders unanimously voted for the strike.\\nDittes, in a letter to members Saturday night, said there remained many outstanding issues that negotiators still need to reconcile, including differences between the parties on wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, job security and profit sharing. The listed issues were expected to be some of the most difficult in the negotiations.\\nSince midnight, UAW members with GM have been working without a contract and those working Sunday had to cross picket lines of their fellow union brethren, as UAW janitorial workers at the facilities went on strike at midnight.\\nThe circumstances add to the tension of already unprecedented negotiations, following UAW Region 5 Director Vance Pearson, a member of the unions International Executive Board, by federal officials Thursday with embezzlement of union funds, among other charges.\\nThe affidavit detailing the charges also reportedly implicated UAW President Gary Jones and former UAW President Dennis Williams, along with Pearsons by FBI, IRS and Department of Labor agents two weeks ago. Pearson, who joined the UAW in 1981, succeeded Jones as director of UAW Region 5.\\nFederal prosecutors say Pearson and other unnamed union officials conspired to embezzle hundreds of thousands of dollars in union money for their own personal benefit along with other crimes.\\nThe new charges and implication of Jones, as first reported Thursday night by The Detroit News, raise significant questions about the unions credibility as it works to sign new labor contracts on behalf of 158,000 members.\\n2019 NBC UNIVERSAL', 'author': 'Michael Wayland, CNBC', 'media': None}, 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/couples-virginia-will-no-longer-have-disclose-race-obtain-marriage-n1054531': {'date': datetime.date(2019, 9, 16), 'source': 'MSNBC', 'source_url': 'https://www.msnbc.com/', 'status_code': 200, 'title': 'Couples in Virginia will no longer have to disclose race to obtain a marriage license', 'text': '\\nPeople seeking a marriage license in Virginia will no longer have to disclose their race, the state\\'s attorney general said, announcing that he is eliminating the requirement that sparked three couples to file a lawsuit.\\nCircuit court clerks in the state were notified of the change in an email on Friday, according to the Associated Press.\\n\"These changes will ensure that no Virginian will be forced to label themselves in order to get married,\" AG Mark Herring said in a statement to the AP. \"I appreciate the courage these couples showed in raising this issue, and I wish them all the best in their lives together.\"\\nLast week, three couples filed a joint lawsuit in the Eastern District of Virginia calling the statute \"offensive,\" \"unconstitutional\" and \"reflective of a racist past.\"\\nOne of the couples, Sophie Rogers and her fianc, Brandyn Churchill, went to the Rockbridge Circuit Court clerk\\'s office for a marriage license ahead of their Oct. 19 wedding and was informed that if they do not disclose their race, they would not receive their license.\\nRogers and Churchill, along with the other two couples, had refused to provide their race and were all denied marriage licenses, according to the lawsuit.\\n\"Plaintiffs deem the requirement of racial labeling to be scientifically baseless, misleading, highly controversial, a matter of opinion, practically useless, offensive to human dignity, an invasion of personal privacy compelling an unwanted public categorization of oneself, and reflective of a racist past,\" the lawsuit stated.\\nAccording to the AP, Herring wrote a note to the director and state registrar of the Division of Vital Records saying that circuit court clerks have to, by law, ask people wishing to obtain a marriage license their race but they do not have to answer.\\nThey will be given a marriage license whether they disclose their race or not.\\nMinyvonne Burkeis a breaking news reporter for NBC News.\\n2019 NBC UNIVERSAL', 'author': 'Minyvonne Burke', 'media': None}, 'https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/sen-elizabeth-warren-on-the-rachel-maddow-show-tuesday-9-17-68931653613': {'date': datetime.date(2019, 9, 16), 'source': 'MSNBC', 'source_url': 'https://www.msnbc.com/', 'status_code': 200, 'title': 'Sen.

The former Steelers (briefly Raiders) and now Patriots wide receiver has captivated NFL audiences with a series of incredibly odd activities and decisions. Amusing or mildly irritating, depending on your mindset, Browns behavior was entertaining right up until, suddenly, it wasnt.\\nBut Browns not the first professional player to combine massive talent with massive red flags. Chris Henry was one of the most incredible wide receivers I ever watched play. He was everything you wanted a wide receiver to be: Fast, tall, lithe and wiry, with soft hands that could catch anything in his remote vicinity. He looked like the future of football. He, like Brown, was also a huge pain for every team that employed him, in ways that were both ill-considered and relatively harmless  even amusing.\\nBrowns not the first professional player to combine massive talent with massive red flags. Chris Henry was one of the most incredible wide receivers I ever watched play.\\nHenry would be late for practice and sometimes forget to go all together, and he was constantly getting unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. His college coach at West Virginia, Rich Rodriguez, said he was an embarrassment to himself and the program. When the Cincinnati Bengals drafted Henry to the NFL in 2005, the receiver was quickly suspended for eight games following a stunning four arrests in a 14-month period. These alleged crimes were not particularly malicious offenses; he gave alcohol to a minor, he carried a concealed weapon without a license, he had some marijuana on his possession, he blew too high on a breathalyzer and got a DUI. The rapid succession of the arrests was, frankly, amusing: It is difficult for an NFL player to be arrested for times in 14 months, even if he was trying. Henry even became a bit of a cult hero for his antics on HBOs Hard Knocks. It was sort of all in good fun. It was entertaining.\\nUntil, suddenly, it wasnt. A year after a broken arm ended his career, Henry was killed when he jumped off the back of a moving truck while having an argument with his girlfriend. When doctors did an autopsy, they discovered Henry suffered from a severe form of CTE (a degenerative brain disease found in people who have a history of repetitive brain trauma), making him the first player to have died with the disease while still active in the league. This, despite the fact that he had never been diagnosed with a concussion in his career.\\nSuddenly, all those funny, even endearing Chris Henry missteps and miscues werent so funny anymore. What we saw as an eccentric personality may have simply been a man suffering from a serious brain injury. Since Henrys death in 2009, we have learned more about CTE and the effects it can have on those who may have it, and their loved ones. But Im not sure weve learned that much more about the entertainment part of it.\\nAfter demanding a trade from Pittsburgh after last season  the team he made seven Pro Bowl teams playing for  Antonio Brown showed up at Raiders training camp with a frostbite injury on his feet because of a botched cryogenic session and subsequently began demanding he be allowed to use his old helmet, which the NFL had banned for being unsafe in combatting concussions. (It is worth noting that most medical experts argue that no helmet is truly effective at decreasing concussions. But no matter.) When he stopped showing up to practices he was fined by his team, only to respond by posting the letters about his fines on Instagram.\\nThe next day, Brown reportedly attempted to attack Raiders general manager Mike Mayock, called Mayock a cracker and punted a football while storming away, screaming, fine me for that! He apologized, but then a day after that, he demanded the Raiders release him and posted audio of a phone call with Raiders coach Jon Gruden to his Instagram account. The Raiders did in fact release him, costing him tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed salary. Even, it seemed like the outspoken wide receiver would have the last laugh after perennial champions the New England Patriots signed him within two days.\\nIt is worth noting that the entire sports world was riveted by every twist and turn of this story. Why did he not want the new safer helmet? Why does he have frostbite? Why is he secretly recording his coachs phone calls? Why is he putting all this guaranteed money at risk? Why is this all happening on Instagram? You couldnt turn on a single sports television program without Browns latest wild mood swing dominating the conversation. We loved it. It was incredibly entertaining.\\nThe moment Antonio Brown found out that he was released by The @Raiders. pic.twitter.com/gsMOQMYGIE\\nUntil, suddenly, it wasnt. Shortly after he signed with the Patriots, Brown was served with a lawsuit accusing him of raping his former trainer, a woman he met in Bible study at Central Michigan University, where he went to school. The details of the accusations are deeply disturbing, even before you get to the actual description of the alleged rape. Included are emails and texts sent by Brown to the woman that are not only harrowing but also incredibly disjointed and erratic  exactly the sort of strangeness that we were all so obsessed with just a few days earlier.\\nWe do not know that Brown is suffering from CTE: One of the many cruelties of the disease is that is it undiagnosable until you look at the brain after death. But there his undeniable peculiarities should at least have given us some pause. Now, after Brown has gotten involved in a situation that is truly disturbing and horrible, everyone is putting their hands in the air, not wanting anything to do with Brown and his antics anymore. But just one week ago we couldnt get enough of them. Its all in good fun. Until its not. Maybe it never should be in the first place.\\nWill Leitch is a national correspondent for MLB, contributing editor at New York Magazine, host ofThe Will Leitch Showon Sports Illustratedand the founder of Deadspin.\\n2019 NBC UNIVERSAL', 'author': 'Will Leitch', 'media': None}, 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/sanders-cancels-three-south-carolina-campaign-events-rest-his-hoarse-n1054551': {'date': datetime.date(2019, 9, 16), 'source': 'MSNBC', 'source_url': 'https://www.msnbc.com/', 'status_code': 200, 'title': 'Sanders cancels three South Carolina campaign events to rest his hoarse voice', 'text': '\\nThe Bernie Sanders campaign canceled three South Carolina events Saturday afternoon to help the Vermont senator combat a hoarse voice.\\nAfter a vigorous campaign schedule, Sen.

But meatballs can mean many, many things. First, theres the meat, which can be beef, pork, veal, chicken, turkey or even a combination of two or more. Next, theres flavor. In addition to those Italian American and Scandinavian classics, meatballs can feature a wide range of ingredients to suit the season, your favorite ingredients or even your mood. Theres also size to consider, as meatballs can range from mini to medium to almost-meatloaf size, and of course, they can be cooked in different ways, including in the oven, on the stovetop and in the slow cooker.\\nFor inspiration, we asked a few of our favorite food pros, including Giada De Laurentiis, Teri Turner, Alex Snodgrass, Kelly Senyei and Serena Wolf, to share their best meatball recipes. Here, youll find baked Buffalo chicken meatballs, slow cooker turkey meatballs, pork and sage breakfast meatballs and more. Once you find your favorites, we recommend making extra to freeze, so you can have a meatball meal ready for those busy nights when theres no time to cook or just anytime the craving strikes.\\nMeatballs are often made with breadcrumbs, which help bind the meat and other ingredients together, but TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis has a creative alternative. \"For these light and delicate meatballs, I swap in orzo pasta as a tribute to Italian American spaghetti and meatballs, she explains.\\nBy cooking them right in the sauce, the pasta absorbs all that flavor from the marinara, spreading the goodness throughout the whole meatball!\"\\nZucchini keeps these delicious meatballs from drying out, while also adding a healthy dose of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients, says Serena Wolf, the blogger behind Domesticate Me and author of the upcoming cookbook, \"The Dude Diet Dinnertime: 125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners.\"\\nIt also adds a hint of green to what can often be a boring, brown food. In place of standard breadcrumbs, Wolf uses chia seeds as a binder, which makes these meatballs gluten free and adds extra protein and fiber. Wolf serves them with a cooling and tangy basil yogurt sauce but recommends harissa, romesco, tahini or even marinara sauce as alternatives.\\nI love these meatballs because they are packed with the flavors of traditional breakfast sausage, with no added junk! explains Alex Snodgrass, the blogger behind The Defined Dish and author of the upcoming The Defined Dish: Whole30 Endorsed, Healthy and Wholesome Weeknight Recipes.\\nA double hit of ground and fresh sage give these meatballs a big pop of flavor, but the recipe is surprisingly simple. All the prep is done in one bowl and the meatballs bake in the oven for just 15 minutes. Snodgrass recommends keeping a batch in the fridge to make hectic mornings a bit easier. While they are delicious reheated, they are just as yummy right out of the fridge, insists Snodgrass. Perfect for a protein-packed breakfast while running out the door!\\nWhen it comes to baking meatballs, especially chicken meatballs, the key to sealing in moisture actually doesn\\'t come in the form of an ingredient but rather a simple piece of equipment, says Just a Taste blogger Kelly Senyei, who makes these Buffalo winginspired chicken meatballs in a mini muffin pan. Baking the meatballs in the pan allows all of the released juices to collect and soak back into the meatballs, she explains. Toss them in a spicy, butter-based Buffalo sauce and don\\'t forget to dunk them in a cool pool of blue cheese dressing to tame the heat.\\nGround chicken is a blank canvas, but it doesn\\'t have to be a bland one! insists Senyei. Her Asian Chicken Meatballs pack maximum flavor into each bite thanks to the dynamic duo of garlic and ginger, plus a sweet and tangy glaze made with hoisin sauce and sweet blackberry jam. Senyei wraps these tasty treats in crisp Boston lettuce for serving, which keeps them light and makes them perfect for parties. Best of all, these meatballs can be prepped in advance and taste great as lunchbox leftovers. \\nThey are totally luscious with an updated spice profile, says No Crumbs Left blogger Teri Turner about her Spicy Guajillo Chile Meatballs. Turner, who is also the author of No Crumbs Left: Recipes for Everyday Food Made Marvelous, combines veal, beef and pork for her meatballs but says you can use whichever meat or meat mixture you prefer. She adds guajillo chiles, smoked paprika and coriander to her meatball mixture, as well as her tomato sauce, resulting in a dish so richly satisfying that you dont even need to serve it with pasta. Its the kind of thing you eat and then two months later you find yourself still thinking about, Turner insists.\\nLeave it to De Laurentiis to have another irresistible spin on classic meatballsslow cooker meatballs! By cooking her turkey meatballs low and slow, says De Laurentiis, they stay juicy and tender and so flavorful from all that time in the sauce. Of course, the best part is you can walk away and come back to dinner already done!\"\\nWant more tips like these? NBC News BETTER is obsessed with finding easier, healthier and smarter ways to live.

After a rough first day attempting to make money dancing for men, Constance Wus character Destiny sees a vision in neon lights. Ramona, played by Jennifer Lopez, enters stage right. She proceeds to perform a five-minute strip tease that women half her age would struggle to manage before rolling around on the floor, bathing in money. As she exits the stage clutching a giant wad of bills to her chest, she looks at the flabbergasted newbie and whispers: Doesnt money make you horny?\\nIn the wrong hands, this would be the start of a film no ones career would walk away from.\\nIn the wrong hands, this would be the start of a film no ones career would walk away from. A dash too much self-seriousness, a teaspoon less self-awareness, and the entire project would have crashed and burned. But under the guidance of writer-director Lorene Scafaria, with the help of the indomitable Jennifer Lopez, this is not the beginning of a Showgirls redux. Rather, it is a thesis statement about Americas conspicuous consumption at the height of the Wall Street bubble. Hustlers is here to celebrate those outsiders who reached out for the brass ring of our corrupt capitalist system and took what they wanted without apology or explanation. Sure, these hustlers were committing credit card fraud and drugging their marks. Its an ugly system, and nobody who wants to be rich gets there cleanly.\\nInspired by a true story written up  in New York Magazine, Lopezs character Ramona picks Destiny to join her in what is the beginning of a beautiful yet twisted friendship. Already older than most of her dancing coworkers, she believes Destiny will do well among the high rollers in the private rooms upstairs.\\nAs both women ride an increasingly lucrative wave, first of the economys making and then of their own, they swing between joyous shopping sprees and physical and emotional violence. Thats one of the reasons Hustlers works, the acknowledgement that these women  their attachments, their feelings, their choices  are complicated, messy and often awful. This is not a film about clichs; indeed, as adds more women to the pot, most notably Keke Palmer and Lili Reinhart as co-conspirators Mercedes and Annabelle, it becomes more layered. Even after the 2008 crash, these women push on, motivated by emotions they may never be able to fully articulate even as they fall deeper down the rabbit hole of the scam.\\nThis is a talented ensemble cast. But of the four main actresses, its Lopez who is the most mesmerizing. Shes come a long way from In Living Color, in the process passing through every possible celebrity permutation, from pop star to style mogul to paparazzi favorite, with bouts of acting and reality TV stardom in between. Now, having recently turned 50, Lopez seems to have reached another level; this is the role she was born to play. As the great Beyonc wisely said: A diva is a female version of a hustler. Lopez is here to hustle you from start to finish.\\nAnd this is where the films other secret weapon comes in  its intense self-awareness. The media kerfuffle over Wus alleged diva reputation is part of it, as are the long and seemingly purposeful shots of Lopez walking in a black velour tracksuit hoodie, Juicy floating right above her butt. How can we not recall Lopezs role in making such clothing the hottest couture of the mid-2000s: The boots in her Jenny from the Block video, the tracksuits that were such a stable of her paparazzi photos. Lopez the real-life superstar made these looks aspirational, so that women like Ramona wanted to copy them. Its utterly meta and absolutely on point.\\nThe businessmen with the corporate accounts think they are in control, when really their cards are being maxed out, first at clubs, then at hotels and finally by Ramona and Destiny in a car waiting outside. They say the patriarchy hurts everyone, and Ramonas plan relies on men both behaving badly  and feeling that losing the money is better than facing the humiliation of the truth. Indeed it took a man with nothing to lose, not even his pride, to finally blow the whistle on these scammers. And snarky detectives made him pay for it, even as the true scope of the scheme became apparent.\\nClearly, these women are not heroes, but they are empowered in their own way. We know from the outset their crime spree cant last forever, and yet, as reporter Elizabeth (Julia Styles) admits, none of us feel too sorry for these men they defrauded. Most of these marks were all too happy to treat these women like crap when the power tables were turned. Thats capitalism, baby, and theyre just participating. Get in loser, were going shopping. Itll be glorious while it lasts.\\nAni Bundel has been blogging professionally since 2010.

Kurbo Health targets 8- to 17-year-olds and features a color-coded diet system.\\nSince the app\\'s launch, however, there has been a huge outcry from dietitians, therapists and eating disorder experts. As of now, more than 111,000 people have signed a Change.org petition asking for the apps removal, and protesters gathered outside WW headquarters in New York on Friday.\\nKurbo is really just the latest (and very concerning) example of Americas lack of understanding about dieting.\\nIn truth, however, Kurbo is really just the latest (and very concerning) example of Americas lack of understanding about dieting. The fact that this app features children makes it especially cruel, as it could put kids at risk for developing life-threatening eating disorders, body image dissatisfaction as well as potentially interrupt their growth and development.\\nAmericans have spent over $72 billion a year on dieting and weight loss products, yet dieting is largely unsuccessful. The failure of diets is part of what drives the economics of the industrys success; people need to keep coming back for a different strategy. A 2016 report by the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that dieting is counterproductive and increases the risk of developing an eating disorder. A study of nearly 17,000 children, ages 9-14, found that dieting was a significant predictor of weight gain and led to increased rates of binge eating in both girls and boys. Additional studies show that the more a person diets, the more weight they gain over time.\\nEating disorders always start with a diet, Marcia Herrin, a registered dietitian, fellow for the Academy of Eating Disorders and author of The Parent\\'s Guide to Eating Disorders and Nutrition Counseling in the Treatment of Eating Disorders, said. And of course the kids that are really going to take to Kurbo are those at risk for an eating disorder, she added.\\nIn a large prospective cohort study conducted in Australia over three years that included 14- to 15-year-olds, those who severely restricted their caloric intake and skipped meals were 18 times more likely to develop an eating disorder when compared to those who did not diet; those who dieted at a moderate level had a fivefold increased risk.\\nFailed diets inevitability lead to agonizing weight cycling (the process of going on a diet, losing weight, regaining the weight and sometimes more). When kids (or adults) lose weight, they are praised by society and the underlying message is, you look better this way, not at the higher weight. But since diets are likely to fail, kids are left feeling disgraced and ashamed that they couldnt succeed. The pediatrician may even lament a large jump in weight, adding to the pressure that they should try again. Given the cyclical nature of many diets, some have even wondered if WW is cynically trying to expand its reach in order to make kids lifelong clients.\\nIs @KurboHealth a joke?! I mean seriously? Not only inhumane, but also scientifically inaccurate, misrepresented and clearly unsustainable (unless you keep using @ww_us for life, which is what they want) #wakeupweightwatchers\\nThe way the app works is that it categorizes foods as red (stop and think), yellow (watch portions) and green (eat lots of) in an attempt to guide children into making informed decisions around food. This may seem benign and kid-friendly, but polarizing foods, and in random amounts, as good or bad instills fear and distrust.\\nThis approach disconnects a child from their innate ability to self-regulate their appetite using their hunger and satiety cues, and creates confusion. For example milk, which is high in calcium, is classified as a yellow food in the app, a baked chicken sandwich is red and chia seeds, which are high in omega 3 fatty acids and known to be heart healthy and good for the brain, are also red. \\nThe app also stamps certain foods as yellow, but as portions increase, those foods become red. Yet there is no easy customization for age and size here. Why wouldnt an older, larger-bodied teen be allotted more volume? If a 15-year-old was using the same portion guidelines as an 8-year-old, one could imagine that the 15-year-old would likely get hungry and perhaps even binge eat later in the day, once again increasing feelings of failure and guilt.\\nThis approach disconnects a child from their innate ability to self-regulate their appetite using their hunger and satiety cues, and creates confusion.\\nHaving an app tell you what to eat is dangerous (and stupid) when we know that food plans should be individualized, Herrin says, who is also a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics for the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine.\\nEager-to-be-successful kids might aim for plates that consisted of only green foods, which according to Kurbo, are just fruits and vegetables. Yet if the plate were filled with all green all the time, a significant and dangerous caloric reduction would result, not to mention a protein deficiency (chicken, fish, tofu, beans are yellow foods and red meat is a red food).\\nAdolescence leads to natural increases in height, weight and bone density, and to increases in the size of all the major organs, like the brain and heart; as a result, nutritional requirements increase dramatically during this time. A caloric deprivation of any kind not only could effect the full trajectory of growth and pubertal development, but could also increase incidences of depression and anxiety; cause poor concentration, irritability or poor sleep; effect menstrual status; predispose someone to injuries; and reduce sports performance. In other words, it could be very debilitating.\\nChildren and teens that diet  even if only temporarily  lack energy and show less interest for learning, which in return affects cognitive development and academic performance. The emotional and physical consequences of dieting and food restriction are too risky in this age group, said Dr. Susanne Martin, who is double boarded in adolescent medicine and internal medicine and is the medical director of the Healthy Teen Project, an eating disorder treatment center for adolescents in San Francisco and Los Altos, California.\\nThis is not to say that kids shouldnt be taught healthy eating habits. But they need to be educated in ways that take into account their bodys innate wisdom. Calories or food shame should be no part of the family dialogue, says registered dietitian Rebecca Scritchfield, the author of Body Kindness. An intuitive based eating program, or a connected eating style approach, as described in books for teens like No Weigh! A Teens Guide to Body Image, Food and Emotional Wisdom, helps kids identify manageable hunger, \"deciding from the inside\" what they would like to eat, and helps them to stop when they feel full.\\nIt takes time and many positive conversations and efforts to support childrens healthy habits and reassure your child and yourself that weight is not the focus of concern in your house. Its well being, Scritchfield said.\\nWorking with kids of all sizes to navigate emotions, stress, maintain good sleep schedules, reduce screen time usage, include joyful movement, establish regular and consistent meal patterns that include family meals, and eat intuitively are all strategies that can help kids typically feel their best.\\nNote: This has nothing to do with dieting. Teaching kids that all bodies are good bodies allows kids to grow up more peacefully with their body. Embracing body diversity and size acceptance  and meaning it  sends the message that your child will be accepted independent of body size or shape.\\nWhatever the motivation behind the WW app, it seems likely to do more harm than good. Kids do not need to hear that there is a right and wrong way to look, that diets offer a successful solution or that restricting food amounts and types is the primary response to any body dissatisfaction. By adding to this chorus, Kurbo Health has done little to help teens and has opened another door into the development of eating disorders.\\nWendy Sterling, MS, RD, CSSD, CEDRD-S is a certified eating disorder dietitian and approved supervisor through theInternational Eating Association of Eating Disorder Professionals, and a board certified specialist in sports dietetics.She is the co-author of How to Nourish Your Child Through an Eating Disorder and No Weigh!

Former Vice President Joe Biden plans to makehis most expansive comments to date on the subject of raceSunday,exploring the nations ongoing struggle to live up to its founding ideals of equality ashiscampaign seeks to deepen connections withminoritycommunities.\\nFirst in Alabama, Biden will deliver the keynote address at services marking the 56thanniversary of the bombing of Birmingham\\'s 16th Street Baptist Church, a searing moment amid the civil rights movementthat took the lives of four young black girls.\\nOn Sunday morning, the Biden campaign released excerpts from the speech.\\n\"The domestic terrorism of white supremacy has been the antagonist of our highest ideals from before our founding,\" Biden is expected to say. Lynch mobs, arsonists, bomb makers and lone gunmen  and as we all now realize, this violence does not live in the past.\"\\nThe same poisonous ideology that lit the fuse at16th Streetpulled the trigger in Mother Emanuel, unleashed the anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh and Poway and saw a white supremacist gun down innocent Latino immigrants in an El Paso parking lot with military-grade weapons declaring it would stop a quote \\'Hispanic invasion of Texas,\\'\" the excerpts continue. We have not relegated racism and white supremacy to the pages of history.\\nLater inMiami, Bidenwill makehis most direct appeal to Latino voters to date with a campaign stop that will emphasize the contributions of immigrants in a direct contrast to actions by the Trumpadministration.\\nTogether, his remarks are expected to build on another recent major speech, in Burlington, Iowa. There, Biden noted thatAmericanhistoryis not a fairy tale, but a \"battle for the soul of this nation that \"has been a constant push-and-pull between its nobleaspirations and a legacy of hatred and injustice borne of theoriginal sin of slavery.\\nOn Sunday, Biden will delve more deeply into the roots of Americas racial divisions, aides say, and highlight how he views that there can be no realization of the American dream without grappling with the centuries that preceded it.\\n\"We cant understand this shocking attack without understandingour original sin of slavery and the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon black people in this country since, T.J. Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesperson said previewing hisremarks in Birmingham, where he will link thattragic event with recent events.\\nThe same poisonous ideology that lit the fuse at 16th Street pulled the trigger in Mother Emanuel, Ducklo said. \"The same vitriol and anti-Semitism that launched pogroms in Europe was on full display in Pittsburgh and Poway. The same small-mindedness and xenophobiathat targeted Irish and Italian and Chinese immigrants, each in turn, also stalked an El Paso parking lot with military-grade weaponry.\\nThe speech may also highlight a paradox in Bidens campaign. The formerVice President to the nations first black president enjoys some of his strongest support from black voters. But he has also faced intense scrutiny for both his legislative record and past statements on racial issues.\\nHis opponents seized on comments at a June fundraiser about his work with segregationist lawmakers. And Thursday, his response to a question aboutreparations, including calling for social workers to \"help parents deal with how to raise their children because \"they don\\'t know quite what to do also drew sharp criticism.\\nBiden appeared to offer a preview of his remarks at a fundraiser in DallasSaturday telling donors: \"Hate only hides, it doesn\\'t go away. If you give it any oxygen, hate comes out from under the rocks.\\nIt is not yet clear given the solemn occasion how directly Biden will fault President Trump for stoking racial divisions. In Iowa last month, he condemned the presidentforgivinglicense and safe harbor for hate to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis and the KKK, most notably in his response to Charlottesville.\\nDucklo said Biden intends to call for the nation to again come together \"with persistenteffort, with fortitudein our actions, and with faithin ourselves and the future to move forward and continue the progress towards living up to our founding values.\\nIn the afternoon, Biden will continue to stress that message of unity in Miami, where aides say he will tell Latinos at the historic Ball and Chain Cuban nightclub in the heart of Calle Ocho that the American dream is big enough to continuing welcoming immigrants into the United States.\\nOn the campaign trail he has often mentioned how Latinos play a critical role in todays economy and often thanks immigrants in town halls for choosing America as their new home country. He is expected to build on a message of values that run deep in the Latino community and unites Venezuelans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and more Latinos, which will be represented in the crowd.\\nThe campaign is viewing this speech as a continued effort by the vice president as he continues to speak directly to the Latino community. They expect the president to ramp up travel to reach Latino voters directly from the most populated areas like Miami to lesser known pockets in Des Moines, Iowa throughout the fall.\\nMarianna Sotomayor reported from Miami.\\nMelissa Holzberg\\nWASHINGTON  Three hours of debate on one night is a lot to ask of an audience, so for those who couldn\\'t commit to it all, here\\'s a quick roundup of some of the best NBC News coverage:\\nThe debate topics were nearly identical to the last two debates: health care, immigration, climate change and gun control. And the progressives vs. the pragmatists divide is still intact, despite former Vice President Joe Biden being sandwiched by the two most left-leaning candidates on the stage, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. So while expectations were high that this debate would establish just who the leader of the field is, nothing much has changed since that first debate in June.\\nUnlike the second Democratic debate when candidates didn\\'t shy away from critiquing the Obama record, last night candidates argued why they were best fit to carry-out President Obama\\'s legacy on health care. The most cutting moment? Former HUD Secretary Juln Castro told Biden that he\\'s \"fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama\" and Biden\\'s not. Biden retorted that that comment would come as a surprise to Obama.\\nHeading into this debate, former Texas Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg were fighting to maintain relevance after high-polling and competitive launches.\\nFolks here and NBC News provided real-time analysis as the debate ticked on. Find everything from the Republican response to Beto O\\'Rourke championing mandatory gun buybacks to fact-checks on statements about child poverty in our debate live blog.\\nMelissa Holzberg\\nWASHINGTON  The fourth Democratic debate will be held in Westerville, Ohio on Oct. 15, and potentially Oct. 16 if more than 10 candidates qualify and remain in the race. The DNC announced that CNN and The New York Times will co-host the debate.\\nThe debate qualifications were previously released after several candidates missed the cut for the third debate. The qualifications for October\\'s debate are the same as the September debate, meaning that anyof the 10 candidates onthe stage on the third debate will have already qualified for the next one.\\nTom Steyer,who did not participate on Thursday night, hasannouncedthat he met the debate qualifications for October.That would make it 11 participants.\\nThe format of the debate has not been announced, but CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett, plus The New York Times\\' Marc Lacey, will moderate the debate.\\nMelissa Holzberg\\nWASHINGTON  During last night\\'s Democratic debate, some television viewers saw the first TV ad from the new conservative PAC, New Faces GOP. The ad featured a burning picture of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., while the ad\\'s moderator, the PAC\\'s executive director Elizabeth Heng, decried Ocasio-Cortez as \"the face of socialism and ignorance\".\\nThe ad is the group\\'s first ad of the 2020 election cycle and it spent $96,000 to run it Thursday night in three media markets: New York City, Washington, D.C. and Fresno-Visalia, Calif.\\nHeng, a failed congressional candidate in California, appears in the ad talking about her father\\'s life in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge regime, saying that \"forced obedience,\" and \"starvation\" are the costs of socialism. Ocasio-Cortez has identified herself as a Democratic Socialist, like presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\\nOcasio-Cortez responded Thursday, tweeting, \"Republicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren\\'t racist.\"\\nRepublicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they arent racist.Life is weird!\\nNBC News\\'Elisha Fieldstadt has more on the ad and the reaction to ithere.\\nSami Sparber\\nWASHINGTON Ten Democratic presidential hopefuls will take the debate stage tonight in Houston. A handful of others will not.\\nCandidates qualified for the partys third round of 2020 presidential primary debates by having both 130,000 individual donors and reaching at least 2 percent in four qualifying polls.\\nHeres what some of the other, non-qualifying Democratic contenders are up to Thursday night.\\nTom Steyer:The billionaire activist  who appears to have qualified for the October debate will host a town hall in Iowa before tonights debate begins, according to his campaign. Steyer held similar town halls this week in South Carolina, where on Tuesday he received his first presidential endorsement.\\nTim Ryan:Though he wont be on the debate stage, the Ohio congressman is hoping to reach voters with a self-released album detailing his policy points. Ryan dropped his album, called A New and Better Agenda, earlier this week on Spotify. He also campaigns today in New Hampshire.\\nSteve Bullock:During the day Thursday, the Montana governor will host two events in Iowa with former Iowa First Lady Christie Vilsack, according to his campaign. On Tuesday, Bullocks campaign sought to reassure donors ahead of the debate with a memo emphasizing that the race is far from over.\\nLets start by acknowledging two facts: First, we wont see Gov. Bullock on the debate stage in Houston this Thursday, wrote campaign manager Jennifer Ridder. Second, not a single Democratic primary voter or caucus  goer will cast a vote until February  and we wont choose our nominee until five months after that.\\nJohn Delaney:The former Maryland congressman will be doing press interviews in New York on Thursday, making the case to voters, his campaign tells NBC News.\\nMichael Bennet:The senator from Colorado will be meeting with workers in Iowa. A campaign spokesperson says Bennet plans to watch the debate, though he knows most Americans arent yet tuned into this election.\\nMarianne Williamson:The self-help author will watch the debate from Los Angeles, where she is hosting a watch party and will livestream her post-debate commentary, according to her campaign.\\nTulsi Gabbards and Bill de Blasios campaigns did not respond to requests for comment.\\nAli Vitali\\nHOUSTON Its been a summer of mostly smooth sailing for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as she has climbed in the polls and doled out near-weekly policy plans, all without much negative attention from her 2020 presidential primary opponents.\\nThat could change Thursday night in Houston  and if it does, we may already have a roadmap to possible attack lines. Not from the other 2020 candidates themselves, but from their surrogates in the waning weeks of summer.\\nBiden surrogates, for instance, have attacked Warren on what they call hypocrisy  both of her no-big-donor fundraising pledge and her economic pitch.\\nEd Rendell talked about the issue in comments to the New York Times this week, asking, can you spell hypocrite? Rendell noted that he had held a fundraiser for her in 2018 and also donated to her cause. She didnt have any trouble taking our money the year before, Mr. Rendell told the Times. All of a sudden, we were bad guys and power brokers and influence-peddlers. In 2018, we were wonderful.\\nHe followed the comments with a tough op-edWednesday, chiding Warren and saying she didnt seem to have any trouble taking our money in 2018, but suddenly we were power brokers and influence peddlers in 2019. The year before, we were wonderful.\\nAnd down in South Carolina, Biden-backing Dick Harpootlian recently gave Politico this quote about the cost of her many plans to address the nation\\'s ills: Shes promised about $50 trillion worth of benefits in the last 30 days. Her economics are fraud and at some point someone is going to point that out. Shes a multimillionaire professor at Harvard. She cant rail against the 1 percent  she is one of the 1 percent.\\nSupporters of Sen. Kamala Harris, too, have gone at Warren. Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina lawmaker and now Hardis supporter, told Politico Warren has gotten a pass in both debates and said she has an inability to make her plans actual reality. There are a lot of voters  especially black voters  who will say, A lot of this is pie in the sky and we want pie on the table.\\nAnd at a late August rally, actress and Sen. Bernie Sanders-backer Susan Sarandon told the crowd: [Sanders] is not someone who used to be Republican. She didnt name names, but the subtle dig could very well apply to Warren, who was previously registered as a Republican until her 40s. The knock is even more striking, though, because of how Sanders and Warren have avoided going at each other head to head in this race so far.\\nIf she comes under fire from other Democrats on the debate stage Thursday night, those might be some of the lines of attack to expect.\\nJonathan Allen\\nHOUSTON  Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has won the endorsement of Rep. Ruben Gallego, a rising star in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and a Marine Corps veteran, Gallego said in an exclusive interview with NBC News.\\nKamala, number one, does have the best chance of beating Donald Trump, Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said over the telephone Wednesday as he listed his reasons for endorsing Harris. Shes going to be able to appeal to all angles of our Democratic voting base.\\nHe will serve as national security chair for the campaign, Harris\\'s team said.\\nThe boost comes at an auspicious moment for Harris: just hours before she and her rivals take the stage in Houston for the third debate of the primary season and at a time when her poll numbers have stagnated in the single digits. Harris currently ranks fourth in the Real Clear Politics average of national polls at 6.9 percent.\\nWhile Gallego may not be a household name for most Americans, his endorsement was sought by other contenders for the nomination.\\nWe did get approached by basically every other campaign, he said.\\n\"Ruben has been a champion for immigrants, veterans, and Arizonans for his entire career, and I\\'m honored to earn his endorsement,\" Harris said in a statement provided to NBC.\\n\"From his service to our nation in Iraq to his work expanding Medicaid in Arizona to his leadership on immigration and veterans affairs in Congress, Ruben embodies the best of who we are as a nation,\" she said. \"I look forward to working with him on the issues that are waking working people up in the middle of the night -- as well as turning Arizona blue in 2020.\"\\nPrior to endorsing Harris, Gallego had been chairman of another campaign  that of close personal friend, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who dropped out of the race.\\nJust 39, a Harvard graduate who left school to serve in the infantry in Iraq, Gallego was viewed as a potential Senate candidate in Arizona this cycle beforedeferring to astronaut Mark Kelly.\\nBoth Gallego and Harris pointed to her plan to provide access to housing and health care for half a million more veterans as an area of agreement between them. He said in the interview with NBC that Harris\\'s version of a universal health care plan was the best among the candidates and he praised her work on immigration and other issues of importance to the Latino community.\\nMonica Alba\\nWASHINGTON President Trumps re-election team is taking credit for two Republican congressional victories in North Carolina Tuesday, particularly touting a narrow win in a competitive race in a district Trump won by about 12 points in 2016.\\nIn a briefing with reporters Wednesday, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale argued theres no question Trumps last-minute rally and personal efforts pushed GOP candidate Dan Bishop over the edge in the Ninth District, where he beat Democrat Dan McCready in a special election after last years midterm results were tossed out due to allegations of election fraud.\\nTrump tweeted late Tuesday night that Bishop asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race. Campaign aides declined to offer specifics on what exactly shifted and whether the president himself offered the candidate advice.\\nDespite lowering expectations earlier this week and pushing back on the notion that the congressional district race wasnt a bellwether for next year, the Trump team is now boasting about what the gains mean heading into a general election.\\nThough Trump wasnt on the ballot, Parscale maintained the enthusiasm the president is able to generate when he holds rallies like this weeks in Fayetteville and last months in Greenville, N.C., contributed to driving significant turnout.\\nIn addition to the traditional campaign rallies, the re-elect effort also held fundraisers, organized a multi-stop tour for Vice President Pence, recorded robocalls and targeted online fundraising.\\nBishop echoed that praise for Trump in a Wednesday morning appearance on Fox News where he said that a lot of credit goes to the president for his victory.\\nAides dismissed criticism, however, that the narrow victory spelled trouble for the Republicans heading into 2020. These are isolated moments in time so congratulations to the Democrats for taking moral victory laps last night. We Republicans and President Trump will take the actual victory, senior political adviser Bill Stepien said.\\nAsked whether there is concern about maintaining suburban voters versus rural voters, the campaign said it is not focused on geographic targets and is instead targeting all kinds of communities, regardless of district or state.\\nOn Wednesday, while expressing displeasure with recent polling that shows his approval rating slipping, the president argued he hasnt even started campaigning yet.\\nNotably, Trump is the only modern president to ever file re-election paperwork on the day of his inauguration and his campaign has held dozens of rallies since then. The president officially announced his run for a second term in June, and has held five 2020 events since then.\\nThe House Republican campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, acknowledged Trumps impact on the race in a memo released Wednesday, where they called him the most effective surrogate for Republicans. The group added it believes Trump will be a helpful boost as they try to win back the seats Democrats flipped during the midterms.\\nDemocrats dont share that perspective, however. Theyre confident that the narrow margin of victory in the conservative district is a harbinger of more bad news to come for Republicans in 2020.\\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said in a memo released Wednesday that the result shows Democrats are pushing further into Republican strongholds and Republicans are on their heels heading into 2020. They went on to point to McCreadys focus on health care as one reason why the race was so close.\\nKailani Koenig and Garrett Haake\\nHOUSTON  In a state thats widely known for its expansive gun culture, the candidates competing for the Democratic nomination in next years Texas Senate race are staking out tough positions on the issue of guns in America.\\nWe have to end open carry, former Air Force helicopter pilot MJ Hegar said Tuesday in an exclusive interview with NBC News. It negatively contributes to the gun violence epidemic and the gun culture in this country. But more importantly its an assault on every bystander.\\nTexas claims the highest number of guns in the country, and is one of several states that allows licensed gun owners to openly carry handguns as long as theyre in a shoulder or belt holster.\\nHegar says she doesnt worry how her positions on gun regulations could impact her professional future in a region where political leaders have long sought to expand, not restrict, access to firearms.\\nThe idea that any gun safety legislation is an infringement on 2nd amendment rights is a lie that the gun lobby has very effectively told everybody, she said. Im a gun owner. Im a combat vet. But Im also a mom. Im going to protect 2nd amendment rights but Im not going to allow our country to not protect children, too.\\nThe nations political focus is concentrating on Texas this week as Houston hosts the third Democratic 2020 presidential debate, but the state has also seen its share of attention in the last month with two major deadly mass shootings that have partially reawakened the gun debate here.\\nOther Democratic candidates looking to unseat incumbent Republican John Conyn in next years Senate race here are also eager to call for changes to Americas gun laws that go further than simply passing universal background checks and red flag laws, like amandatory buyback and ban of assault weapons like former Rep. Beto ORourke called for after last months El Paso shooting.\\nIt would be expensive, former Democratic Rep. Chris Bell acknowledgedin an interview Tuesday. But I don\\'t think that assault weapons should simply be confiscated from people who want them legally. I do think that government needs to make that investment and buy those weapons back, and I think it would be money very well spent. I think that\\'s another area where Texas could lead.\\nLongtime political organizer Cristina Tzintzn Ramirez also said shed support the idea of an assault weapon buyback.\\nI\\'ve been waiting my entire adult life for Congress to act to do very basic things like pass universal background checks, to take assault weapons and weapons of war out of the hands of civilians, she told NBC News.\\nHouston City Council member Amanda Edwards emphasized first focusing on passing the low hanging fruit legislation like universal background checks and red flag laws, but acknowledged in an interview that the idea of assault weapons bans or buybacks aresomething that we need to be exploring.\\nThats a conversation, I dont know if it has the same slam dunk effect as universal background checks, she said. But weve got to look at keeping our families and our communities safe.\\nBen Kamisar\\nWASHINGTON  Jon Ossoff, the Georgia Democrat who narrowly lost a pivotal 2017 House special election, will run for Senate against Republican Sen. David Perdue, he announced Monday night.\\nOssoff tipped his hand on Monday night during an interview on MSNBC\"s \"The Last Word with Lawrence O\\'Donnell,\" arguing that he will help \"mount an all-out attack on political corruption in America.\"\\nAnd he said that his 2017 bid in a race that was then the most expensive House race in history has made him battle-tested. \"I will never be intimidated from telling my own story and touting my own accomplishments,\" he said.\\nOssoff officially rolled out his campaign Tuesday morning with a video thatframed his congressional bid as a starting gun for Democratic efforts to expand the electoral map.\\n\"We believe the battle that began in Georgia in 2017 will be won in Georgia in 2020 when we flip the Senate and win the White House,\" he said in the video.\\n\"The world we are building together is so close we can almost see it. But we have to fight for it  and we know how to fight.\"\\nOssoff also announced an endorsement from Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the dean of Georgia\\'s congressional delegation and a seminal civil rights leader, an endorsement that could help his efforts to win a crowded Democratic primary.\\nThe Democrat joins a handful of others running in that primary for the right to face off against Perdue. Former Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Sarah Riggs Amico, former Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson andClarkston Mayor Ted Terry are among the candidates already in the race.\\nBy running against Perdue, Ossoff decided against running for the seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson at the end of this year. Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will nominate someone to serve until the November election, but the retirement will put two Senate races on Georgia\\'s ballot next year  one for the seat currently filled by Perdue, and one for the right to serve out Isakson\\'s term through 2022.\\nRepublicans are already trying to label Ossoff a failure for his 2017 loss, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee labeled him a \"failed congressional candidate\" in a news release arguing that he is too liberal to represent Georgia voters.\\nFailed congressional candidate, @ossoff, joins fellow unaccomplished, far-left candidates in the already-crowded and divisive Georgia Dem primary. Welcome to the circus!   #GASen #gapol pic.twitter.com/GKSQGfV42X\\n\"The bitter and divisive Democratic primary welcomes another unaccomplished, far-left candidate,\" NRSC spokesperson Nathan Brand said.\\n\"Failed congressional candidate Jon Ossoff\\'s serial resume inflation and extreme left-wing views will fit in with the rest of the crowded Democratic primary but will stand in sharp contrast to David Perdue\\'s positive record of delivering results for all of Georgia.\"\\nBut Democrats have signaled they think Georgia could be competitive  2018 gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams sent every Democratic presidential campaign a \"playbook\" on Monday with her advice on how to win Georgia and other tough states in 2020.\\nAbrams narrowly lost her gubernatorial bid, but has decided against running for either Senate seat in 2020. She\\'s considered a possible vice presidential pick for the eventual Democratic nominee.\\nAlex Seitz-Wald\\nWASHINGTON  Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, a rising star in the Democratic Party likely to end up on any nominee\\'s vice presidential shortlist, sent a \"playbook\" Monday to every presidential campaign with her recommendation for how to win Georgia and the country in 2020.\\nThe 16-page document warns that \"any less than full investment in Georgia would amount to strategic malpractice\" and urges Democrats to replicate nationally what she did in Georgia by focusing on \"expanding the electorate\" with people who don\\'t often vote, rather than trying to persuade the \"relatively small\"number of swing voters.\\n\"Our unprecedented campaign received more votes than any Democratic candidate for any office in Georgia history, fueled by record-breaking support from white voters and presidential-level turnout and support from the diverse communities of color in our state,\" Abrams wrote.\\n\"However, I am not the only candidate who can create a coalition and a strategy to win this state, and Georgia is not the only state poised to take advantage of demographic changes.\"\\nGeorgia has not been major battleground state in the past. But it could be one next year at both the presidential and congressional levels, thanks to it having an unusual two Senate seats on the ballotafter the impending retirement of Republican Sen.

It would also mandate that people who own weapons that become illegal under the new policy sell their guns back to the government.\\nWhen asked why his position shifted from beyond his initial call for an assault weapon ban with no mandatory buyback, the Texan pointed to the recent tragedy in his hometown that prompted him to take a break from campaigning before returning as an even more vocal proponent of reforming gun laws.\\nOn Aug. 3, in El Paso, with 22 people killed and dozens more grievously injured, I could no longer accept that would be enough because there are still more than 10 million assault weapons, weapons of war, out on the street, he said.\\nIf we agree they are dangerous to sell and that we should stop selling them, then we also have to agree that these are instruments of terror that are still out there and have to be brought back home or they are going to be used against us.\\nORourkes proposal has become central to his presidential bid. After he passionately defended his buyback proposal on the debate stage last week, his campaign attempted to seize on the moment to fill its fundraising coffers, offering a shirt on its online store that reads: Hell yes were going to take your AR-15.\\nBut that direct call has prompted criticism from Republicans, as well as concern from within his own party.\\nDelaware Democratic Sen.

We\\'re looking at obstruction of justice, abuse of power, corruption broadly. We\\'ve engaged in hearings, we\\'re going to continue to bring witnesses before the committee, compel the production of documents to make clear no one in this country is above the law.\"\\nCicilline, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said the panel will \"follow the facts\" and \"at the conclusion, make a recommendation.\"\\nOn Thursday, the Judiciary Committee passed a resolution along party lines setting procedures and rules for future impeachment investigation hearings.

Nadler contends that it can be designated as an impeachment investigation simply because they are considering articles of impeachment.

And there are some who believe that we should not impeach him because it will be a failed exercise in the Senate.

For former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, the moment came just as his political star was rising. In October of 2018, in the final stages of what looked like a successful mayoral bid and while part of conversations about potential 2020 contenders, Kander stepped back. After 11 years of trying to outrun depression and PTSD symptoms, I have finally concluded that its faster than me, he wrote. That I have to stop running, turn around, and confront it. \\nNow, nearly a year later, he joins \"Why Is This Happening?\" to talk about what brought him to that point. He walks through his deployment and the lasting impact of living in mortal danger, how he used running for office as a coping mechanism, and the life changing power of therapy. \\nJASON KANDER: I would have nightmares pretty much every night. I went about 12 years without a good night\\'s sleep. I was coping with it by not dealing with it. But then my unconscious mind was like, \"We\\'re going to deal with this.\" When I went to sleep, my guard was down, and it would just flood in, and I dreaded sleep.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Hello, and welcome to \"Why Is This Happening?\" with me, your host, Chris Hayes. Back in 2016 which was, you might remember, was an election year in 2016. You also may not remember how that ended up, but it was not a great year for Democrats, that election year. Not just because of what happened in the presidential ticket, which was that Donald Trump got elected president. It\\'s still wild to say that sentence, isn\\'t it? But also really bad downstream. There was a lot of hope for a bunch of Senate wins that did not work out. In some ways, it\\'s a lesson about the fact that the top of the ticket matters so much in presidential election years. It\\'s very hard to divide the fates up. But one of the democratic candidates who overperformed the most and came the closest in some of the most hostile terrain, was a guy who made a big splash with this ad that he put out supporting universal background checks for guns.\\nI\\'m going to describe the ad to you because this is a good visual medium, where he\\'s blindfolded and, in 30 seconds, he assembles essentially a military style rifle. He\\'s got it, he\\'s blindfolded and he\\'s putting it together and he\\'s talking about how his opponent is criticizing him for not supporting guns and says, \"I support the Second Amendment, but I support background checks.\" Then he takes the blindfold off and he says, \"I want to see my opponent do this.\" It\\'s a pretty badass ad. He had served in the army, and his name was Jason Kander. He was the Secretary of State for Missouri and an extremely promising young democratic politician. He lost by only a few percentage points in a state that Trump carried by a shocking margin.\\nThen afterwards he was kind of a star, particularly because everyone\\'s running around being like, \"Who knows this new political terrain in which Donald Trump won Missouri by 18 points or something like that?\" Like, \"Well, this guy. He knows it. He figured it out because he got some voters that voted for Donald Trump because he outperformed Hillary Clinton in Missouri by 15 points.\" There\\'s some people out there that were like, \"I like Jason Kander. I like the cut of this guy\\'s jib. I like his rifle assembly skills.\" He became this really important national voice. There was some talk that he was going to run for President of the United States. He then said he was going to run for mayor of Kansas City. Then he just announced, \"I\\'m not going to run for mayor. I\\'m dropping out of running for mayor. I\\'m dropping out of politics and public life for now because I have PTSD that I have not dealt with. It\\'s getting to a point where I can\\'t function at this level. I need to treat it, and I need to go and deal with that.\" It was a really remarkable moment in public life.\\nI don\\'t think I\\'d ever heard anything like it. A very prominent politician first talking about struggles in their mental health, specifically a veteran talking about PTSD at that level, and then stepping back from public life to get treatment and then re-emerging to talk about what happened. That\\'s where Jason Kander is now and that\\'s the bulk of our discussion today. Jason Kander is now working for a veterans organization called the Veterans Community Project. He\\'s leading their national expansion. They already existed in Kansas City. He\\'s talking about what his experience was, and how he got help, how others can get help. This is an extremely moving and compelling story. He\\'s an extremely dynamic and compelling guy. I think, if you listen to this conversation, you can understand why he performed as well as he did in that election and why he was seen as such a promising politician. He is a just deeply compelling figure.\\nBut also it touches on PTSD in the context of veterans who have served in combat zones in the longest period of ongoing combat in the history of the United States. Jason, as you\\'ll hear, served one deployment. There are people that have served six deployments, seven deployments in this era who have been in combat almost nonstop, oscillating in and out of country for years. There are hundreds of thousands of folks who have had to deal with mental health issues in the wake of that through the VA and other places. I should say that, in this conversation, we do talk about suicidal ideation. If that\\'s something that\\'s triggering for you or you want to steer clear of that, it\\'s something we talk about in this conversation. For people that are both veterans and not veterans, people who have struggled with mental health themselves or who have loved ones, there\\'s something to find here about how someone goes about admitting to themselves that they need help.\\nWhere\\'d you grow up, Jason?\\nJASON KANDER: I grew up in the Kansas City area. My family is fifth generation. I\\'m fifth generation. My son\\'s actually sixth generation now, Kansas City.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Am I right that, somewhere my memory is stored the idea that the famous musical theater author, Kander, is related to you?\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah, I\\'m related to him. Really. He\\'s my great uncle John. We\\'re really close. He\\'s my grandfather\\'s brother.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Oh, wow. Oh, so it\\'s not distant at all. That\\'s your great uncle John.\\nJASON KANDER: No, I talked to him the day before yesterday or maybe yesterday for an hour. We\\'re really close, and he\\'s been a big part of my life.\\nCHRIS HAYES: He broke Cabaret among other things, right? He\\'s a legend.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah. Cabaret, Chicago, New York, New York.\\nCHRIS HAYES: My God.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah. You\\'d really think I could play an instrument. But no. I\\'m in showbiz for ugly people. I spent a lot of time in politics.\\nCHRIS HAYES: What was your upbringing like in your household? What were the politics in that household like?\\nJASON KANDER: Oh, well, you know, my parents were juvenile probation officers. That\\'s how they met. Then, my dad became a small business owner, and he was a cop for a while. The politics of the house, my whole family, we\\'ve been liberals for a long time. I remember my dad used to mess with some of the relatives by pretending he voted for Bush, Sr. That\\'s the kind of household it was. But I don\\'t remember us talking about politics that much when I was a kid. We just talked a lot about, and this sounds corny, but just doing what\\'s right. It was really more about leading by example for my parents. They took kids in whose families were struggling, and we refer to them as my foster brothers. They didn\\'t go through the foster system. My younger brother and I had all these brothers. The politics in my house was just, \"You know, we\\'ve been really fortunate, so we have an obligation to help other people.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: What was that experience like? My wife and I talk about this, actually, a lot. We talk about doing that at some point when our kids get older. I\\'m curious what that experience was like.\\nJASON KANDER: It was really good for me because I didn\\'t realize ... We never wanted for anything, but I didn\\'t realize that I was actually privileged until I got to college because, growing up, even though there was money in the family, I shared everything. T-shirts, shorts, rooms, it didn\\'t matter. We didn\\'t go on as many vacations because we had a whole lot of people to take with us.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\\nJASON KANDER: I didn\\'t get the big G.I. Joe thing usually, whatever it was.\\nCHRIS HAYES: That\\'s amazing. What you\\'re saying is it diluted the privilege in a way that was good for your upbringing.\\nJASON KANDER: See, that\\'s my theory, but it may just be that my parents did a really good job of not letting me realize.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. Right.\\nJASON KANDER: As a result, when I got to college and I realized, \"Oh, I\\'ve got a relative paying for this,\" that\\'s when I thought, \"Oh, okay, I\\'m super fortunate.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\\nJASON KANDER: But the good thing was I was still really grateful for everything growing up. I just never got to have even one moment where I had any excuse to ever think we were in somehow better than... nothing. It was just like, \"We\\'re just another family.\" It was good for me. Not that money makes you better, but you know what I mean.\\nCHRIS HAYES: No, of course not. Of course not.\\nJASON KANDER: How a kid would misunderstand.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, yeah. When did you first start to think that you\\'d like to join the service?\\nJASON KANDER: I grew up, like a lot of kids, I was really into G.I. Joe and all that. But also, my dad had been a cop when I was really young. I remember thinking that that was amazing. Right? Walking around wearing his uniform, his police uniform. For Halloween I was always a soldier. It was there; it was something I thought I wanted to do. But then by the time I was going to college, I really put it in this category that was the \"maybe one day category.\" I really admired service and I thought, \"One day I\\'m going to do that.\" But I think if 9/11 had not happened, there was about a 50/50 chance I would have finished law school and become a reserve JAG officer or something. But because 9/11 happened, I flipped that whole equation. Instead of it being, \"Maybe one day,\" it became, \"I\\'m going to do this.\" Then I became an army intelligence officer. That definitely changed my track. But basically 9/11 is when I said, \"This is happening.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: How old were you when 9/11 happened?\\nJASON KANDER: I was 20 or 21.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Were you in college still?\\nJASON KANDER: I was, yes. I was 20 and I was in my third year, which was my last year at American University.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Did you enlist right after that?\\nJASON KANDER: Well, I wanted to, but then I was in a pickup football game where I demanded to play tackle, which was pretty stupid.\\nCHRIS HAYES: I look back at my youth. 21\\'s old to be making that demand, but until I was about 19 and 20 we would get together and play tackle football. I do not know what the h--l I was thinking.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah, yeah. I\\'ll tell you what I wasn\\'t thinking about. The fact that one of my buddies was all state free safety in Texas and was on the other team. He and I are still close and we still argue about whether I was in the end zone on this play. The end zone, of course, being a shirt that we threw down. Like, \"That\\'s the end zone.\" And anyway, I tore my ACL. At the time, the Army had a policy that that was an injury that you were disqualified. I remember some of my professors who were all Vietnam-era folks saying, \"That\\'s great. You can\\'t be drafted.\" I was like, \"No, I actually want to go in.\" I had to do surgery, physical therapy, and then by 2003 I was enlisted. In 2002 I had enrolled in ROTC.\\nCHRIS HAYES: What was that experience of just basic training and acculturating to that world like for you?\\nJASON KANDER: I really took to it. I did Army ROTC while I was at Georgetown Law School. I was really supposed to be very focused on law school. Law school was comparably very boring to me as compared to being out in the woods with a compass and figuring out how to do buddy rushes 30 seconds at a time with blank rounds. That stuff was exciting. Also, keep in mind, the country was going to war.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. Right.\\nJASON KANDER: I had joined for that reason. So, in my mind I was exactly like my grandfather and my great grandfather who had gone in but didn\\'t have military careers. It\\'s just the country went to war, so that\\'s what you do. I took to that very well from a personality standpoint. I remember at first feeling like I was a law student who spent weekends and some evenings in uniform. By the end of law school, I very much felt like a soldier who usually, during the day, had to be a law student.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Were you surprised or not that you took to it in the way you did?\\nJASON KANDER: I guess what I was surprised with was it was really hard. Here I was, by the time I was getting ready to get my commission, I was only I think 24. The two years before that, 22 to 24, there was a group of us who are grad students in that ROTC program who we referred to ourselves as the Old Man\\'s Club because everybody was so young and comparably spry. Here I was with this knee injury and just trying to get through it physically but also mentally and emotionally, it was not the easiest thing.\\nIt sometimes surprised me how tough it was, which I appreciated, because by the time you start law school, not a knock on law school, but you\\'re going to finish, right? You\\'re paying your money.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\\nJASON KANDER: It\\'s like Taekwondo, right? You keep paying, they give you the belts. I was pretty sure that I was going to finish that, whereas there were plenty of times in Army Officer Training where I didn\\'t know if I\\'d make the finish line. That was a surprise. I don\\'t think it was a surprise to anybody in my family that I joined. In fact, on 9/11 I heard from family members who were just saying, \"We know you\\'re going to join. Just don\\'t do it today.\" It was always in my makeup.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Now you\\'re a soldier, you\\'re an officer, you have your commission and you\\'re also a J.D. Is it 2004 by that point?\\nJASON KANDER: I got my commission on May 20th, 2005.\\nCHRIS HAYES: At that point you\\'ve watched the trajectory of American foreign policy and war fighting go from a response to 9/11, war on terror, the invasion of Afghanistan, into Iraq, the run up to that, the initial invasion. Then things kind of falling apart after that first four or five, six months. What are you thinking as you\\'re thinking about the fact that you\\'re likely to deploy into a war zone?\\nJASON KANDER: I remember election night 2004, being on the phone with a buddy of mine who actually just ran for Congress this past cycle. We were both in the same ROTC program. His name\\'s Dan Feehan. I remember Kerry was ahead for a bit that night. I remember us having a conversation literally about how it affected our life expectancy. I remember having that conversation about who won that presidential election and how it would affect us. But that aside, for the most part, I was really in the mentality at that point, and I think appropriately so, of somebody who was just going into the job. I wasn\\'t thinking about the politics of it that much.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I followed it. I had strong opinions about I didn\\'t think Iraq made any sense. But because I knew what I was going into, and because I knew that I planned to volunteer to deploy, and I didn\\'t know whether I\\'d get Afghanistan or Iraq, I preferred Afghanistan just because of the mission made more sense to me, I was really much more focused on really learning my job and learning the craft because people would say to me all the time, especially when they knew I was going to volunteer to deploy, they would say, \"But why would you do that? You don\\'t have to go. Obviously you\\'re not somebody who has to be in the service.\" I would always say the same thing, which was, \"If I do my job well, then maybe some other American soldiers get to come home safely.\" That sounds cornball, right? But that\\'s just how I saw it.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah.\\nJASON KANDER: It made sense to me. Because I had been raised to understand that we had been given a lot in our family and so therefore we had this big obligation. To me, I would get angry when people would say things to me about, \"Why would you have to go?\" Sometimes people would even say things like, \"But you have this education. Why would you go be a ground pounding intelligence officer when you have this law degree from Georgetown?\" That stuff would make me angry because I just felt like, \"Who are you to tell me that I\\'m better and should put-\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\\nJASON KANDER: I just thought that was so wrong.\\nCHRIS HAYES: When did you first deploy?\\nJASON KANDER: I kept asking to go and then I got there on the ground October, 2006. I was only there for four months in Afghanistan.\\nCHRIS HAYES: What were you prepared for and what were you not prepared for?\\nJASON KANDER: It\\'s interesting. Even though you get the training, you can\\'t really prepare for a couple of things. The first thing is no matter how much they train you, you can\\'t help, at least in my case, picture a more conventional idea, largely from the movies and TV, of what you\\'ll first see when you get there.\\nWhat I expected was what I think most people expect, which is armored Humvees and a big, tough looking dude up on a giant machine gun up on top. I just thought, \"That\\'s how we\\'ll travel.\" That is not how I traveled. As an intelligence officer, and particularly with the limited resources that they were sending to Afghanistan at the time, I rode around in a unarmored Mitsubishi Pajero, which is really just the Mitsubishi version of a Ford Escape. It\\'s pretty much the same vehicle. That was a bit of a shock, my first convoy. From an equipment perspective, from a general \"what it really feels like to be there\" perspective.\\nBut then the other thing is you get used to in the Army  and by that point I\\'d done ROTC, I\\'d done some active duty training, I had done army intelligence school, so I\\'d been in a world that in the army they referred to as TRADOC, which is training and doctrine command. That\\'s pretty much where everybody is up until they get to their first job. This was, save a few months in Tampa in a reserve duty, this was really my first job, being an Afghanistan, my first job over there. I had been in the utopian military environment where everything works the way it\\'s supposed to.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. Right.\\nJASON KANDER: Right. You do the job you\\'re trained to do. Then I get over there, and I was a second lieutenant, so O1, very first level of officer. They said, \"Well, you\\'re replacing an O5,\" which was a lieutenant colonel, which is somebody who\\'s been in the army 20 years and here I am, I\\'m wet behind the ears. This is, I just think, how war is. It wasn\\'t like, \"Well, this obviously works the way you would expect.\"\\nYou just show up and they say, \"Okay, we\\'ve got two possible gigs we need you to do. We have this analytical position looking at intelligence or I guess working in a night shift, I think it was. Then you write some stuff up. And then the other thing is this job where you go out and you collect intelligence about the corruption and the other threats and espionage and that sort of stuff, narco trafficking, that we need to collect on because we\\'re working with these Afghan government officials. You would just go out and you would talk to people, pretty much by yourself a lot of the time, figure that stuff out, come back and write about it.\" Clearly the first job was a lot safer, but I was 25 or whatever and thought I was bulletproof and also felt like, \"Well, I came here to do something important.\" So I picked that one. But, really, the part I wasn\\'t prepared for was the part where you show up and they\\'re like, \"Okay, you\\'re going to replace this guy who would usually be your boss\\'s boss\\'s boss.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Where were you stationed?\\nJASON KANDER: I was out of Kabul, Camp Eggers. I went east a bit, but I spent a lot of time in and around Kabul.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Did you like that work?\\nJASON KANDER: I loved it. I loved every second of it. Don\\'t get me wrong, sometimes you\\'re homesick, sometimes you\\'re just sick because you\\'re out, in my case, out on the road eating Afghan food in meetings, and they don\\'t have necessarily the same rules that we were accustomed to about preparing food, that kind of stuff.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\\nJASON KANDER: Don\\'t get me wrong, it was still a war. There were parts that sucked. But I felt like every part of me was at full utilization so often. That\\'s, in some ways, I think once you\\'ve done that there\\'s just part of you that\\'s always trying to get back to that for the rest of your life.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah. I\\'ve heard that before from other folks, from other vets. Were you aware of that in the moment? There\\'s times in my life, I\\'ve never deployed to a war zone, there\\'s times in my life where I\\'ve done things where I feel like, A, a state of flow and, B, a state of a perfect match between the challenge and my abilities that are just right, kind of tied. Like, \"This is hard, but I\\'m operating at full capacity and just being able to do it in a way that feels satisfying.\" Is that-\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah, it\\'s that, but add in just unnatural, maximum adrenaline levels on a semi-regular basis. For me, as an intelligence officer, and I guess this would be a third thing that maybe was not what I expected, and I\\'ve spent a lot of years sort of having to come to terms with the idea of thinking about my version of combat as combat, because I never had a bullet whiz by my ear. My vehicle never blew up. I never had to kill anybody. And so, I spent a lot of years saying, well that wasn\\'t combat.\\nWell, I spent a lot of time, many hours at a time, out, oftentimes just with my translator as my sort of backup. And, nobody knew where I was. And, I would go into these meetings with armed people who I couldn\\'t know their allegiances for sure, and couldn\\'t know for sure that I wasn\\'t about to be kidnapped and killed. And, while that is horribly frightening, when you\\'re doing it, and other people around you are doing it, it seems really normal.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\\nJASON KANDER: And, it\\'s incredible what can seem normal. And so you, while at first you\\'re just really, really frightened, you go on to stay really frightened, but you don\\'t realize it.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah.\\nJASON KANDER: Because it kind of just becomes a state of being. And then, there are moments where you go, and the way I would always think of it was, I would think, this is like a movie. Where, I had one of my best contacts was the Afghan attorney general. And, I thought he was a great contact because well one, he spoke English, and two, he didn\\'t have a real discernible motivation to kidnap me. So, that made for a pretty great contact.\\nCHRIS HAYES: A good combo.\\nJASON KANDER: And, I was fond of working with him. And, we were in a meeting with him once, and it was myself, and somebody from another intelligence shop that had come along, and we\\'re sitting with him, and he\\'s got this person with him who was a prosecutor in one of the outlaying provinces. And, he said to us early in the meeting, the attorney general did, he said, \"Don\\'t worry, he doesn\\'t speak a word of English.\"\\nAnd then, he proceeded in English to tell us that this man has been involved in several failed plots to assassinate him. And, the guy\\'s just sitting there, nodding like a person does, like, oh, a joke\\'s been told. But they don\\'t know that, what it was.\\nAnd then, the person I was with went out to smoke a cigarette a little bit before we left, and then she came back in, and she just looked just white, like something terrible had happened. And, the guy on the couch who didn\\'t speak any English had already left before that. Well, I found out when we got in the vehicle to leave, that he had bummed a cigarette, and they were smoking together, and of course he wasn\\'t saying anything.\\nAnd, after a few minutes, in perfect English, he says, he\\'s like, \"Where are you from?\" And she tells him, and it turns out, he says, \"Oh yeah, I own some nice farm land in Nebraska.\" I mean, so stuff like that would happen.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Oh.\\nJASON KANDER: And, you\\'re just like, you don\\'t realize that you\\'ve just had this insane adrenaline moment, but you also at the time just think, okay, that\\'s like a movie. So that\\'s, that was an incredible job.\\nCHRIS HAYES: How do you think about what that constant presence of adrenaline, and the constant possibility of violence, as this just sort of, a lurking possibility, what do you think that was doing to you psychologically and spiritually, while it was happening?\\nJASON KANDER: Well, if you had asked me that a year ago, I\\'d have said, oh nothing. Because I was in denial about it, and because I thought it was sort of necessary to my career ambitions to continue to be in denial about it.\\nBut now, I\\'ve been through about eight months of therapy, and I can tell you that what it did, it did several things. I mean, one thing was that it, well it gave me post-traumatic stress, but in the specifics, it gave me symptoms like hypervigilance.\\nAnd really, it took a while for my therapist to sort of help me understand that my reactions over there, by becoming hypervigilant, by always thinking about how many exits there were, by always having four different plans as to how you were going to get out of a situation, that\\'s a really normal survival instinct in that environment. And, the hard part is you come home, and then you\\'re supposed to turn it off.\\nAnd, another aspect to that, by the way, is that in order for me to be able to do that work, the Army had to not just train me. The Army had to, and I don\\'t say this really in a negative way, they had to kind of brainwash me.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Mm-hmm.\\nJASON KANDER: And, what I mean by that is, they had to say to me, over, and over, and over again, and this is true of every soldier. They had to get it across to me that somebody was doing something harder than me. That most people had it harder than me. And, that\\'s true no matter what your job in the Army. And that\\'s necessary.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\\nJASON KANDER: Because, if they hadn\\'t put that in me, I couldn\\'t have gone into all those meetings.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\\nJASON KANDER: Because, I would have consciously said, no, this is super dangerous. But, because that was in there going, well, look, all my friends are doing harder stuff-\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\\nJASON KANDER: The problem is, nobody turns that off when you come home. It\\'s vitally important that that be part of you when you\\'re there, in order to do your job. But, you really don\\'t need it when you get home. In fact, it\\'s a real hindrance when you get home, because then as you start to deal with these things, you are saying to yourself, okay, other people have it worse. Other people deserve this, I don\\'t.\\nBecause nobody ever sat you down and said, okay, that was some crazy s--t. You need to know that. And it\\'s not normal, what you had to go through. And now, it\\'s going to be hard to come out of it. And so, as a result, what it did to my body and my brain is, it just sort of taught me that I was in danger all the time. And then, I never, well, not until recently did I unlearn that.\\nCHRIS HAYES: I want to know about what your coping mechanisms were over the last several years, before you addressed it through treatment. So, let\\'s talk about that after this break.\\nPart of what you\\'re identifying is that you didn\\'t think there was a thing to cope with, because it was what was normal and what was the product of your training, and in fact adaptive in that environment. So it\\'s not like, if we have a traumatic experience in civilian life, a loved one dies in a car crash, everyone recognizes that you have suffered a trauma. And, whether you\\'re a super repressed person, or you\\'re not a super repressed person, or a spiritual person or not, or you would go to therapy or not, there, you at least recognize, oh, there\\'s a trauma here.\\nJASON KANDER: Mm-hmm.\\nCHRIS HAYES: I\\'m grieving, I\\'m sad, I lost this person I love. What I\\'m hearing from you is just, there\\'s not even the recognition. It\\'s like that joke about the fish in water, right, where the old fish swims by the two fish, and says, \"Enjoy the water.\" And the young one says, \"What\\'s water?\" Right?\\nJASON KANDER: Right.\\nCHRIS HAYES: What were you doing psychologically as a coping mechanism? How did you deal with the fact that the fight or flight system in your brain at some level is always engaged?\\nJASON KANDER: Well, I kind of, it is exactly like the story about the fish in the water, because I thought I was the only rational person. So, for instance, well I\\'ll just go through some of what the last several years have been like, prior to dealing with this.\\nI mean, I would have nightmares pretty much every night. I went about 12 years without a good night\\'s sleep. At the beginning, they were nightmares that were really all about what I had feared over there. Getting kidnapped. They were very specific to Afghanistan, into what happening, that kind of thing.\\nAnd then, over time they evolved, and they started to take on my everyday environs, and sometimes they didn\\'t have anything to do with the military, but it was the same threat. I would try to cope with that by, and I even wrote about this in my book. I thought I had fixed it by not reading about things that had to do with kidnapping, or sometimes just avoiding Afghanistan stuff altogether. I wouldn\\'t watch war movies, that kind of thing.\\nI learned over the last eight months that that\\'s avoidance, and it\\'s actually the opposite of what I needed to do. So now, I get a lot fewer nightmares, because of the therapy. But, I get them sometimes.\\nBut, now I know what to do. I will do the opposite of what I used to do. If I\\'m having real bad nightmares, I will pull up my phone, and I will watch a clip of Band of Brothers, or something like that. And, that allows my brain to process this stuff.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow, huh.\\nJASON KANDER: What I didn\\'t realize was, I was coping with it by not dealing with it. But then, my unconscious mind was like, we\\'re going to deal with this. So, when I went to sleep, my guard was down, and it would just flood in and my, I dreaded sleep, and so I would stay up.\\nOther stuff, the hypervigilance, I mean, it was, it\\'s kind of crazy the profession I chose, but crowds were sometimes difficult. So, if I was giving a big speech, or any speech, I would shake every single hand in the room. One, because I knew that was just a good thing to do as a politician, but two, because it allowed me to kind of look at everybody, and assess the threat, and just feel a little more comfortable when I got up on the podium.\\nI almost never sat with my back to the door, anywhere. When I was Secretary of State, I can remember several times, people must\\'ve thought it was really strange, that we had this meeting room that was like this very large room, and I would, I had a rule that nobody could sit behind me. And I\\'m, I don\\'t consider myself to have been like a high maintenance boss. So, this was very out of character. And, everybody just came to know, don\\'t sit behind Jason, in this huge room, where they ...\\nAnd, stuff like that, now looking back, it should have been more clear to me. But, because I had friends who had been in a more traditional type of combat, who had had to take lives, it felt to me like saying that I had post-traumatic stress was stolen valor.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah.\\nJASON KANDER: And, so I just couldn\\'t do it.\\nCHRIS HAYES: So, you come back after this deployment, when do you first run for office?\\nJASON KANDER: My first time on the ballot was \\'08. So, I started running in August of \\'07, I started knocking on doors. I mean, I-\\nCHRIS HAYES: That\\'s not that long after you come back.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah. And I had been raising money and stuff like that before that. But, I started like really, really running in August of \\'07. No, not long at all. Looking back now, I recognize I was in a bit of a hurry to not deal with myself.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah. And there\\'s, I mean, it\\'s of obviously, an extremely different thing, but there\\'s a lot of adrenaline involved in the campaign.\\nJASON KANDER: Mm-hmm.\\nCHRIS HAYES: If you\\'re kind of jonesing.\\nJASON KANDER: Absolutely.\\nCHRIS HAYES: If your body\\'s jonesing for adrenaline, that\\'s one place in civilian life to get it.\\nJASON KANDER: Yes. And, the other thing that I now realize is that, and part of this is being, I think is common to folks who have experienced trauma, and part of it is just general survivors guilt, that a lot of soldiers get, whether they experienced post-traumatic stress or not.\\nI felt really strongly that I had not done enough.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, yeah.\\nJASON KANDER: And, I went over there saying, if I do my job well, I\\'m going to help some folks come home. And I just never, ever even came close to feeling like I had done enough. And, in a lot of ways, running for office, trying to do these big things, part of it was the adrenaline of the competition, and that sort of thing.\\nBut, a really big part of it, and a big part of everything I was doing, was just this really, really deep and unquenchable thirst for redemption. A feeling that I was worthy of this, worthy of coming home safe.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Because you felt like your experience, in your deployment, and in a war zone, had not earned that redemption. That you had not done enough, and you had not ... Is that because you were not in firefights? What was that?\\nJASON KANDER: I think probably there was virtually nothing I could have done that would\\'ve-\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, right-\\nJASON KANDER: ... made me feel that way. I know that now.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, because people who are in firefights, and in fact people that do the bravest things imaginable feel that way, too, so.\\nJASON KANDER: Absolutely. A buddy of mine said to me once, he said, \"Man, somewhere there\\'s a World War II veteran sitting around at a VFW hall, explaining that look, the guys in the front of the landing craft at D-Day are the ones who had it real bad.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\\nJASON KANDER: \"He was in the back of the landing craft.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, right.\\nJASON KANDER: And that\\'s, because that\\'s how they program us. And again, I don\\'t fault them for that. It\\'s the lack of deprogramming that causes the problem.\\nCHRIS HAYES: So clearly, you\\'re a young man on the make here, in that you\\'re ambitious. You come back, and you\\'re running for office. Did you run for the state legislature first? Is that right?\\nJASON KANDER: Mm-hmm. Yep.\\nCHRIS HAYES: You win.\\nJASON KANDER: Yep.\\nCHRIS HAYES: And then, from that you go to secretary of state?\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah. And just to, the whole, how hard charging I was, and the need to just constantly be working. That state legislative campaign, I knocked on 20,000 doors. I mean, we ended up winning, it was a three-way race, we got 68 percent of the vote.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah.\\nJASON KANDER: I probably could have dialed it back a little. I probably didn\\'t need to lose 15 pounds knocking on doors in the neighborhoods in Kansas City.\\nAs an aside, by the way-\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah-\\nJASON KANDER: ... when I walked in here, Brian, the engineer, I said, \"Nice to meet you.\" And he said, \"Actually, we met at my door, like 10 years ago.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Oh, really?\\nJASON KANDER: I mean, this happens to me everywhere I go in Kansas City. It is one of the real upsides of having done that, as I kind of don\\'t meet a stranger.\\nCHRIS HAYES: That\\'s amazing.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah.\\nCHRIS HAYES: So, when does your wife come into the picture?\\nJASON KANDER: So, Diana and I actually met when we were 17. We\\'ve been together this whole time.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow.\\nJASON KANDER: So, she\\'s had the brunt of the whole thing.\\nCHRIS HAYES: And then, so you go from state legislature, and then secretary of state, right?\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah.\\nCHRIS HAYES: At that point, are you, I guess it\\'s you and McCaskill, are the two statewide elected Democrats. Right?\\nJASON KANDER: Actually, this was kind of amazing, because it\\'s not that long ago. But, in 2012 when I got elected secretary of state, the next day, or when I got sworn in, six out of the eight statewide elected officials were Democrats in Missouri.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow. Wow.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah. It was governor, treasurer, attorney general, secretary of state, one of the senators.\\nCHRIS HAYES: That\\'s wild. I can\\'t believe that.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah.\\nCHRIS HAYES: That feels like another universe, because that state has gone-\\nJASON KANDER: It\\'s amazing-\\nCHRIS HAYES: ... so far in the other direction-\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah-\\nCHRIS HAYES: ... in such a short period of time.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah. Yeah. They just had, they had one senator, the auditor, and the lieutenant governor.\\nCHRIS HAYES: And so, then you ran that race for the U.S. Senate in-\\nJASON KANDER: \\'16.\\nCHRIS HAYES: In \\'16, right.\\nJASON KANDER: Mm-hmm.\\nCHRIS HAYES: What was that race like?\\nJASON KANDER: That race was a whirlwind man. I mean, I had done a statewide campaign, but I had done a secretary of state\\'s race where, here\\'s how I described it to somebody once. A buddy of mine, who had also been a statewide politician in Missouri, he asked me the difference between the secretary of state\\'s race and the Senate race.\\nAnd I said, \"You know, when you were in college, and you were thinking maybe one day you\\'d run for office, and all you really knew about it was \\'The West Wing.\\' And that was it. Your whole frame of reference was watching \\'The West Wing.\\' And then, you ran for state house, and you\\'re like, well this is nothing like \\'The West Wing\\' is.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: This is not \"The West Wing.\"\\nJASON KANDER: It\\'s \"Parks and Rec.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, yes.\\nJASON KANDER: But it\\'s not-\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yes-\\nJASON KANDER: It\\'s not \"The West Wing.\" And that was fine. You found you liked \"Parks and Rec.\" And then, you ran for secretary of state, and there were occasional moments where you\\'re like, ooh, this is \"West Wing-ish.\" But, you didn\\'t have all these staff, and you didn\\'t have these people following you around.\"\\nAnd, I told him, I said, \"Running for the U.S. Senate in a national, in essentially a national race, where it may determine the control of the Senate, and it\\'s the closest race in the country. Especially considering that, when you started, nobody had any idea that Missouri was ever going to even be close, and nobody was thinking that way.\"\\nAnd I told him, \"It turns out, that\\'s when it starts to feel a little like \\'The West Wing.\\'\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. Right.\\nJASON KANDER: And, I don\\'t mean like glamorous, I just mean like, oh wow, there\\'s a lot of people here.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah.\\nJASON KANDER: And, they seem to really be interested in this.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yes. Yeah, because I mean, I\\'ve covered politics for most of my career, and one thing that always struck me is early on, when you\\'re covering local races, is how unglamorous it is.\\nJASON KANDER: Oh, yeah.\\nCHRIS HAYES: And, I\\'ll never forget watching this congresswoman in her primary, who ended up losing to Rahm Emanuel, when he ran for that seat, just shaking hands with elderly folks in a bingo hall, on the northwest side of Chicago. And, they could not be bothered to, they didn\\'t want to shake her hand, they wanted to listen to the bingo numbers.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah.\\nCHRIS HAYES: And, I\\'m watching her sort of try to get their attention. I\\'m just like, damn dude, this is humiliating. And, this was one of my first bits of campaign reporting. And I was like, oh this is just what it\\'s like to run for office.\\nYou have to kind of impose yourself on people\\'s time, and you have to kind of beg for their attention a little bit. And, you\\'re kind of supplicant a lot.\\nJASON KANDER: Oh, yeah.\\nCHRIS HAYES: The way that it works in \"The West Wing,\" or other kind of depictions, where there\\'s like, the candidate is the principal, and sort of at the top of this big totem pole, or pyramid, or hierarchy.\\nAnd in reality, it\\'s just like you\\'re begging a lot, for people to pay a little attention, or sign your petition, or take the lit that you have in your hand.\\nJASON KANDER: It\\'s, every time I talk to somebody who says, \"Hey, I think I may want to run for office.\" And they say, \"Will you have a phone conversation with me about it?\"\\nSure. Okay. So we talk. And, I\\'m listening very closely at the beginning of each of those conversations, because when I ask them about their campaign, if it started, or what their plan is, if at any point in it they say to me, in the first few sentences, well, I\\'m going to go to all the events, and I\\'m...\\nAnd, if they use the term speech writer, if they think they\\'re going to have a speech writer, or anything like that, I\\'m just like, I just stop them. I\\'m like, \"You shouldn\\'t run for office, because this is door to door sales and telemarketing. That\\'s what this is.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, yep.\\nJASON KANDER: And frankly, you don\\'t get to do the door to door, which I really enjoyed, when you run for the U.S. Senate, but it\\'s still unfortunately, a whole lot of telemarketing.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, yeah. You\\'re dialing for dollars. I mean, that race was, you kind of broke out. You had this very famous ad, where you assembled an assault weapon blindfolded. Right?\\nJASON KANDER: Mm-hmm.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Am I getting that right?\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah, yeah, that was my argument for background checks.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. For background checks. It is a great ad. We\\'ll link to that. And then, you over-performed the top of the ticket, the presidential nominee in your state by quite a bit. You ran a very good race, were not able to actually win.\\nBut, you\\'ve come back, you\\'ve now been this person who you went to college, you enlisted after 9/11, then you went to law school, and you\\'re ROTC, and then you deployed, and then you came back, and then you ran for one office and won that, and then you ran for another office and won that.\\nAnd now, you\\'ve run for this and you\\'ve not won. What that was doing to you psychologically, about who you are, and what your sort of role was, your destiny, and things like that.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah. At the time, I of course didn\\'t think about any of that. At the time, I just thought-\\nCHRIS HAYES: Just push it down.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah, no, that\\'s exactly right. It was, in fact, there\\'s a part in my book where I said something about, if you\\'re really upset by everything going on in the world, just stay busy.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, yeah.\\nJASON KANDER: And I think man, after eight months of therapy, I think I might change that advice. But, I really believed at that time, and I was making the argument all over the country, that look, Missouri is still a bellwether state, and that\\'s what I was telling everybody.\\nAnd, part of what I was doing was, is you had to believe that. And, even absent of that, we got well over 200,000 voters who voted for Trump, and for me. I mean, we had people showing up at our rallies who were Trump people. And, I was a progressive. So I mean, I really believed in the case we were making. Our last poll, and I think also the other guy\\'s last poll, had us winning.\\nWe ran 16 points ahead of the ticket, but it turned out that that day that was 2.8 percent not enough, because, and people forget this, Missouri actually was a larger margin for Trump than Mississippi. He won Missouri by 19, he won Mississippi by 18. So, that was too much to overcome.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow.\\nJASON KANDER: And to be honest, I just couldn\\'t get my mind around that at first. I mean, at first it was devastating. Oh, we lost. And then, later in the night it was, Oh my God, Trump won.\\nAnd I guess, there\\'s no saving grace at all to Trump winning. But, I suppose in the personal grief process, that was so overwhelming-\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, totally. I\\'ll never forget, I, Jonathan Alter, who is also a Cubs fan, that was 2016. Every time I would see him around 30 Rock, we\\'d talk about the Cubs, and we were psyched. And of course, the Cubs win the World Series, for the first time in over a hundred years, four or five days before Trump\\'s elected.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah.\\nCHRIS HAYES: And then, Trump is elected. And then, I think a day after Trump\\'s elected, I see Johnathan Alter in the green room. And, he looks at me, I haven\\'t seen him. And he\\'s like, \"Hey, how about the Cubs?\" I\\'m like, \"How about the Cubs? How about the Cubs?\"\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah.\\nCHRIS HAYES: \"Are you out of your f-----g mind?\"\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah.\\nCHRIS HAYES: \"You want to talk to me about the Cubs?\"\\nJASON KANDER: Ah, yeah. Man, I remember having conversations, friends who are also in politics would call me in the couple of weeks after, and they\\'d say, \"How are you feeling?\"\\nAnd I would say it was weird for me, because I had just lost this race, and I kind of expected to just disappear into oblivion, from a political relevancy standpoint, but for whatever reason, people wanted to hear more from me, and so people would call me and say, \"How do you feel about this? People keep wanting to talk to you.\" And I said, \"You know, it\\'s sort of like there was this nuclear event, and we\\'ve all come up from the bunkers, and I\\'m supposed to take solace in the idea that I\\'ve been elected leader of our group of seven.\" It was just coming to terms with that, figuring out...and then personally because of the stuff I was going through, I now can look back and realize that there was a part of me that was like, \"I have to figure out a way to keep going because I can\\'t just sit around here and deal with myself. That is not going to happen.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: So, then what happens that makes you realize you do have to do that? I mean, I ran into while you were... you had a national organization that you were working on and fundraising for that was sort of voter involvement and voter protection. There was talk about other elected office. There was talk about mayor, even higher offices at certain points. And then there was-\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah, I mean I\\'ll just flat out, I can say now, I was going to run for president. So how did I deal with it? I was like, \"Well, I\\'ll just save the world.\" I didn\\'t know that that was a coping mechanism, and also  I want to give myself some credit  it was also a sense of patriotic duty.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, right. And you\\'d just run 60 points ahead of... I mean, like you said, in the nuclear wreckage for the Democratic Party, people were sort of sifting through and finding little jewels from the lost civilization, and you were one of them.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah, so I\\'m like, okay, I guess I should do this. And you were asking what that was like, what that feeling was like of I can\\'t just sit around here. The best way to describe it is it\\'s just this tension, and I would say to my wife sometimes, I would say... there are a few things I would say that now I look back and I\\'m like, \"Well, that was an indicator.\" One was I would say, \"I feel like I\\'m dying.\" And now I recognize, with the help of my therapist at the VA, that one of the things that happens with trauma is that once you\\'ve sort of experienced something where you actually think you might die because you\\'re out there alone and you\\'re in this room with a guy you think is bad, that kind of stuff, you have trouble not taking other things that are bad or stressful and not dialing them all the way up the meter.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. Like, \"I am dying,\" or \"my life is in danger,\" or \"people I love are in danger.\"\\nJASON KANDER: Exactly. And all three of those. You nailed it. So that was part of it, and then also this constant... even once Let America Vote, my organization, got going and sort of a dry run presidential campaign, and all of a sudden we had this big team, the other thing I would say to my wife all the time was, \"I feel like I\\'m disappointing everyone all the time.\" And she would say, \"There\\'s literally no evidence of that,\" but it just felt that way to me all the time, and that was me projecting out the fact that I was constantly disappointed in myself. And a lot of that had to do with I was carrying all this inner turmoil around, and I didn\\'t feel I could share it with anybody, including even those closest to me like my wife, and I had just sort of settled in. I mean, by that time, it had been a decade and I had forgotten that I didn\\'t use to be like this, and so-\\nCHRIS HAYES: That\\'s intense, dude.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah, so I just like, \"Well, this is who I am I guess, and some people don\\'t get to be happy.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. I\\'m just tortured. I\\'m tortured, and I can\\'t sleep, and I have nightmares, and I\\'m never going to be good enough, and I\\'m disappointing everyone and I\\'ve got to go, go, go to keep it going, and if I let go of the kite for a second, it\\'s all going to float away.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah. And if I let go of the kite for a second, it\\'s all going to float away, and because of that, I really dislike myself. It\\'s sort of a self-loathing and a shame that goes over all of it.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Had you never been in therapy before?\\nJASON KANDER: I went to a guy once because I thought, \"I have bad dreams. I\\'ll go to a dream guy,\" and that didn\\'t work because I should\\'ve gone to a trauma guy.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. Yes, the dreams. Yes, the dreams are-\\nJASON KANDER: I went to like three appointments, so not really.\\nCHRIS HAYES: So what was it that you felt... what got you to the point where you\\'re like, \"I can\\'t. This is not working.\"\\nJASON KANDER: So there\\'s the cumulative buildup, and then there\\'s the moment where I was like this is real. I had off and on had suicidal thoughts for a few years by that point, but they were usually several months apart, like real bad bouts.\\nCHRIS HAYES: But they were intense, like you would go through ideation about killing yourself?\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah. There are degrees of it. I mean, so I didn\\'t really... I never had a plan which I guess is an important aspect of it. It didn\\'t get to that point, but that\\'s where it was going, and so... and that was more just about I can\\'t escape this. And I also felt like a burden because here I was, gone all the time, and I didn\\'t think I was any fun to live with, which that I was probably right about. And so, all this was laying on me and it was getting worse, and on top of that, everything objectively was... just objectively, professionally, things were great. My podcast was number one in the country when it launched. My book became a New York Times Bestseller. I had decided a few months before, \"Okay, something\\'s wrong with me, so I\\'m going to go home and run for mayor instead of president and I\\'m going to go to the VA.\" Of course, I never did the VA part at that point.\\nSo now I\\'m running for mayor. It was going great. We sold $25,000 worth of T-shirts in the mayoral campaign on the first day. We raised three times as much as the other eight people in the race combined in the first three months. I mean, I was going to win, and objectively I was like, \"Things should be great.\" And I realized the campaign had been 99 days long and I had had 98 bad days, and it was just getting worse and worse.\\nAnd so I called the Veterans Suicide Hotline, the Crisis Line, and I talked to a woman on the other end of the phone, and I expected... because I was, like probably a lot of people, I just felt like, \"Well, I don\\'t really have this problem, and I don\\'t have post-traumatic stress, and I\\'m going to call this number but there\\'s just something wrong with me. I\\'m different than other people.\" And the whole time I\\'m talking to the lady, I was just so struck by the fact that she... it sounded from her voice like this was no different than any other call she had had that day, and I sounded like every other veteran who was going through this. I could tell. And that was it for me, I just realized... honestly, then my wife and I googled post-traumatic stress, and read it and it was like it was written for me, and I just kind of broke down crying. And it was like, \"Okay, I got to deal with this.\"\\nCHRIS HAYES: Did you talk to other people that you had served with or that were also had been deployed in Afghanistan or Iraq during this period or before that moment when you called that hotline?\\nJASON KANDER: One of my best friends is somebody who has post-traumatic stress and has dealt with it at the VA and on the one hand was very much a mentor to me in this process, and on the other hand, and this was through no fault of his own, he had been through two deployments in Iraq of really intense in the street, door-to-door fighting, and so he was also sort of represented to me like real post-traumatic stress. And that was through no fault of his own, and he would tell me like, \"Dude, I would not have been able to do what you did.\"\\nAnd meanwhile, you were saying did I talk to others, throughout the years, I\\'d be out on the campaign trail, I\\'d meet veterans, I\\'d talk to friends of mine, I\\'d talk to soldiers of mine, and I had no problem counseling people and saying, \"Look, what you experienced is real. You need to get treatment. You\\'ve earned it. It\\'s strong to do it.\" I could tell other people that but not do it myself, which is... it is what it is, and I think a lot of people... one of the biggest things I\\'ve heard back from folks is that my saying, \"Look, I didn\\'t think I did enough and yet I have this,\" was maybe the most important thing I said as far as other veterans go.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. Because there\\'s a lot of people carrying that around.\\nJASON KANDER: And not just veterans. So many people have trauma.\\nCHRIS HAYES: I mean, dude, this is like a hobby horse of mine, and the space that you\\'re talking about is something I have no subjective access to whatsoever. I\\'ve never served a day. I have been fairly removed in my personal life from the experience of war and its aftermath, but in other parts of my life I\\'ve dealt with people, I\\'ve been adjacent to people that go through intense trauma, and whether that\\'s sexual assault or that\\'s abuse or that is people in our lives who have extremely deep addiction problems, there\\'s a lot of trauma walking around out there, and a lot of people who think that the trauma that they\\'ve experienced isn\\'t real or isn\\'t important enough or isn\\'t messing them up or even know the vocabulary to talk about that. And so, I think you\\'re right that the context of this is bigger than the specifics of PTSD in the context of war. There\\'s a lot of people with a lot of trauma that is messing them up that really could stand to use to talk to someone.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah, and when I was living this life that was sort of made for... you know that package you put together of a politician and you roll it out as a product and, \"This guy\\'s got it all together, and he\\'s going to lead,\" and nobody would ever come and talk to me about their issues. And then I put it out in the world what I had been through, and thousands of people including people who are very close to me who I had no idea what they had been through. And once I had put that out there, people would come up and they would talk to me about it, and then I could help them and I could say, \"You should go see somebody.\"\\nAnd the thing about that is you don\\'t have to be somebody with hundreds of thousands of social media followers to make that difference. If you in your workplace say, \"This is what I\\'ve been dealing with, and I go to a therapist for this.\" One, it\\'s important that people have the courage to do that because it\\'s going to be to your benefit because people around you will support you through that, but also because you are then doing that in your orbit because there will be somebody else in your social orbit or your workplace who will go out and maybe save their own life because you did that.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Did you do therapy through the VA?\\nJASON KANDER: I did, yeah.\\nCHRIS HAYES: And what was that experience like?\\nJASON KANDER: Fantastic.\\nCHRIS HAYES: That\\'s great to hear. I ask this... one of my best friends in the world, actually, he is a psychologist at the VA, and I\\'m always sort of in awe and admiration of the work he does, and it seems like they do really amazing work.\\nJASON KANDER: They really do, and you got to separate two things. There\\'s the VA as far as the system and the way it\\'s been set up and some of the difficulties of it, which the organization I work with now, Veterans Community Project, helped me navigate that, and we\\'ll talk about that in a minute. But then the other part of it is the actual clinical side. The treatment, it\\'s just outstanding.\\nAnd when I made my announcement, I said, \"I\\'m going to go to the VA in Kansas City and get help for this,\" so many people, and well-meaning people, reached out to me and said, \"You need to go to a private provider. You have means. You have insurance. Why would you go to the VA?\" And I told people, I said, \"Look, I want to talk to people who talk to people like me all day,\" and that\\'s what I did. There was never a moment where I said to my therapist at the VA anything and he went, \"What?\" or, \"Whoa, that\\'s weird.\" It was never a moment. It was more just like a nod and like, \"Yep. And let me explain why you feel that way right now,\" because what he dealt with was combat post-traumatic stress.\\nCHRIS HAYES: And that specialty, like you said, you tried someone without that specialty and it didn\\'t work.\\nJASON KANDER: It\\'s also by the way why the VA, it\\'s so important that we protect it as it is because now that I\\'m enrolled there, I go to the VA for other stuff. My primary care is there. I\\'m thinking about getting shoulder surgery. If I do, I\\'ll do it there. But it\\'s not like that it\\'s just, \"Oh, they have a doctor who would do the surgery on my shoulder.\" It\\'s the people who do that work there understand, \"Oh, well this injury may be from the fact that this guy probably carried a rucksack long distances,\" or... you know? It\\'s just when you work with people who all had the same occupation at some point, you\\'re just able to get right to what might be going on with him a lot faster.\\nCHRIS HAYES: It\\'s overly reductive or tried to be like, \"What\\'s the big lesson here of the Jason Kander journey?\" But you and your wife have been talking about this new organization you\\'re starting, and clearly you feel like it\\'s important to talk to both vets and non-vets about getting treatment and talking to someone and mental health. What\\'s the thing that you came out of this now knowing about yourself or about the world or about life on the planet Earth that you didn\\'t know before?\\nJASON KANDER: Well, first, I want to be real clear the organization I\\'m working with, Veterans Community Project, I\\'m leading the national expansion, but it was started by some awesome combat vets three years ago.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, yes. I\\'m sorry. Sorry for that.\\nJASON KANDER: It\\'s okay. I just want to make sure that I\\'m not trying to steal their thunder because what they\\'ve done is amazing. I feel like I have two roles that I want to play right now in the world. Both of these are second to I\\'m really focused on being a dad and a husband right now in a way that I haven\\'t, and I can\\'t even say haven\\'t had the opportunity to do over the last several years, I didn\\'t have the sense to do over the last several years. And not even sense like... I just wasn\\'t capable of it, and now I am, and I am flipping loving every... I mean, I\\'m coaching my son\\'s baseball team.\\nCHRIS HAYES: That\\'s great.\\nJASON KANDER: So, that\\'s the number one stuff for me right now, and then second to that are two things. One is demonstrating for folks that post-traumatic growth is a real thing and it\\'s achievable and it\\'s worth going after as hard as it can be to go after it, and that\\'s just sort of... and talking to you right now and that kind of thing in a way that a lot of people will hear.\\nBut then the other part is this organization, Veterans Community Project, it\\'s based in Kansas City, and we call it VCP. I toured VCP six weeks before I made my announcement about stepping out of public life, and I was just blown away by it. I mean, they do two things. They help any veteran who walks in the door. They\\'ve served thousands of veterans in Kansas City, and it\\'s a walk-in clinic, and they just fill in any gap that exists in Veterans Services for any veteran. And the second is they\\'ve effectively ended veterans homelessness in Kansas City by creating a village of tiny homes with on-site wraparound services. And those two things are really inspiring, and I saw it, and I was amazed by it. And then I just went back to call time and campaigning and as you do on the campaign trail.\\nAnd then I made my announcement six weeks later, and I found that there were a bunch of hoops that I wasn\\'t exactly sure how to jump through in order to get the mental health services I needed at the VA. And I was really struck by that because I was thinking, \"Man, I got this phone full of influential contacts. I\\'ve got a law degree from Georgetown. I\\'ve got pretty high level government experience. I\\'m not homeless like a lot of the people VCP serves, and I\\'m kind of overwhelmed at the moment about what to do here.\" And so I called up these guys. I knew Bryan, who\\'s our CEO, he had interned for my secretary of Ssate\\'s race back in the day, and he had given me the tour. And he was like, \"Yeah, man. Come in.\" And so they just treated me like any of the thousands of vets.\\nCHRIS HAYES: That\\'s awesome.\\nJASON KANDER: Yeah. And it made a huge difference. They handled my paperwork, got me into the mental health stuff at the VA quickly-\\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow.\\nJASON KANDER: ... and I was so turned on by that that as I started to get better and treatment started to really take hold for me, I started hanging around, and they had had inquiries from all over the country, people wanting them to expand into other cities. And they kind of said, \"Look, you\\'ve created a national organization before. Why don\\'t you help us do that?\" And so it was a natural for me, so now that\\'s what I\\'m doing. I want to solve veterans homelessness and serve every veteran who\\'s fallen through the cracks, and I think VCP can do that.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Jason Kander is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. He\\'s also a former state legislator and secretary of state and U.S. Senate candidate and an all-around extremely fascinating and open-hearted person. It was really great to talk to you, Jason. Thank you very much.\\nJASON KANDER: Thank you, Chris. Good to talk to you, man.\\nCHRIS HAYES: Once again, my great thanks to Jason Kander. That organization\\'s called the Veterans Community Project. We have a link on our website. He\\'s the founder of Let America Vote. He\\'s a former Secretary of State of Missouri. Also, I want to give a shout out here to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline which is... you should put in your phone, actually, because you should have it in your phone if you encounter a loved one who you think needs it. It\\'s 1-800-273-8255.\\nAlso mentalhealth.va.gov, and there\\'s a phone number to call, a number to text, you can chat online if you are a veteran, and you\\'re feeling in any way the way that Jason describes himself feeling, you can go there. As I said in the conversation, one of my best friends in the world is a psychologist at the VA, and I\\'m just always amazed at the work they do and the diligence and dedication that those folks have over at the VA for all the critiques there have been at the sort of bureaucratic level, the people working there are truly amazing people.\\nAnd as always, you can send us your feedback to the email address withpod@gmail.com or on Twitter hashtag WITHPod.
